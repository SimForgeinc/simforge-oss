//! Physically based real-time atmosphere (Hillaire 2020 LUT model).
//!
//! This module replaces the fixed sky cubemap / gradient path (see
//! `crate::lighting::synthetic_sky_cubemap`) with a real participating-medium
//! atmosphere. It is a thin, physically-parameterised driver over Bevy
//! 0.19.1's built-in `bevy_pbr::atmosphere`, which implements
//! [Hillaire 2020, *A Scalable and Production Ready Sky and Atmosphere
//! Rendering Technique*][paper] — the same technique as Unreal's
//! `SkyAtmosphere` — with exactly the LUT chain the paper specifies:
//!
//! | LUT                  | Bevy default        | what it stores                                  |
//! |----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
//! | transmittance        | 256x128 2D          | T(r, mu) to the top of atmosphere               |
//! | multiple scattering  | 32x32 2D            | O(1) isotropic multi-scatter factor psi_ms      |
//! | sky view             | 400x200 2D          | camera-oriented non-linear sky radiance         |
//! | aerial perspective   | 32x32x32 3D         | frustum-fitted inscattering + transmittance     |
//!
//! and composites the solar disc *after* the sky-view LUT sample
//! (`bevy_pbr::atmosphere::functions::sample_sun_radiance`), because a
//! 400x200 LUT cannot preserve a 0.53 deg disc.
//!
//! ## Why the built-in path
//!
//! Discovery (Bevy 0.19.1, `~/.cargo/registry/.../bevy_pbr-0.19.1/src/atmosphere/`)
//! found the complete paper implementation already in-tree and wired into
//! `PbrPlugin` by default: `transmittance_lut.wgsl`,
//! `multiscattering_lut.wgsl`, `sky_view_lut.wgsl`, `aerial_view_lut.wgsl`,
//! `render_sky.wgsl`, `environment.wgsl`. Crucially it also closes the
//! energy loop that a bolt-on sky plugin cannot:
//!
//! * `pbr_lighting.wgsl` multiplies every `DirectionalLight` by
//!   `sample_transmittance_lut(r, mu_light) * calculate_visible_sun_ratio(..)`
//!   under `#ifdef ATMOSPHERE`. So `DirectionalLight::illuminance` must be
//!   the **extraterrestrial** normal illuminance; the atmosphere itself
//!   performs the air-mass attenuation and the below-horizon cutoff. Passing
//!   a ground-level lux value here would double-count the attenuation.
//! * `AtmosphereEnvironmentMapLight` filters the sky-view LUT into the
//!   diffuse/specular IBL cubemap, so ambient light *is* the resolved sky.
//! * `render_sky.wgsl` composites the aerial-perspective LUT over opaque
//!   geometry with dual-source blending, so distance haze on the scene and
//!   the visible sky come out of one solve. `DistanceFog` must therefore be
//!   off, or the scene gets fogged twice.
//!
//! A custom render plugin would have had to re-implement all of that.
//!
//! ## Divergences from the paper that this module corrects
//!
//! Bevy's convenience constructors are not used, because two of their values
//! disagree with the paper (verified against the source, 0.19.1):
//!
//! 1. `ScatteringMedium::earth` sets the Mie term to
//!    `absorption: 3.996e-6, scattering: 0.444e-6` — the paper's numbers are
//!    the other way round (`beta_sca = 3.996e-6`, `beta_ext = 4.40e-6`, so
//!    `beta_abs = 0.404e-6`). As shipped, clear-air aerosol has a
//!    single-scattering albedo of 0.10 instead of 0.91, which kills the
//!    forward Mie glow around the sun and makes haze absorb rather than
//!    scatter.
//! 2. The same constructor writes its exponential falloffs as `8.0 / 60.0`
//!    and `1.2 / 60.0`, i.e. it assumes a 60 km atmosphere, while
//!    `Atmosphere::earth` spans 100 km (6360 -> 6460 km). The falloff
//!    parameter is `1 - altitude / (outer - inner)`, so those scales are
//!    effective scale heights of 13.3 km and 2.0 km, not 8 km and 1.2 km.
//!
//! [`earth_terms`] uses the paper's values with the correct 100 km
//! normalisation.
//!
//! ## Weather
//!
//! Weather is not a set of brightness multipliers here; it is aerosol and
//! cloud physics added to the same medium, so one solve drives the visible
//! sky, the sun's colour/transmittance, the IBL and the aerial perspective:
//!
//! * **Boundary-layer haze/fog** — a grey Mie term whose ground extinction
//!   comes from Koschmieder's relation, `beta_ext(0) = 3.912 / V`, minus the
//!   background Rayleigh + tropospheric-aerosol extinction already present,
//!   with a shallow scale height (`FOG_SCALE_HEIGHT_*`).
//! * **Tropospheric aerosol** — the paper's Mie term, scaled by Linke
//!   turbidity (`T_L = 1.9` is a Rayleigh-only atmosphere, 2.5 typical
//!   clear, 6+ heavily polluted). `haze` folds in as extra turbidity.
//! * **Cloud deck** — a dense, nearly conservative (`albedo 0.9999`) Mie slab
//!   between a base and top altitude, vertical optical depth driven by
//!   coverage. Because it lives in the medium, the transmittance LUT
//!   attenuates the beam and the disc through it, the sky-view LUT brightens
//!   and flattens, the environment map follows, and the aerial-perspective
//!   LUT stays consistent — with no separate cloud shading path and no
//!   double-counted energy.
//!
//! **Honest limitation:** that deck is *horizontally uniform*. It is a real
//! participating medium, shaded by the same scattering solve as the rest of
//! the sky — it is not volumetric cloud rendering, it has no cloud shapes,
//! and it casts no per-cloud shadows on the ground. Broken cumulus therefore
//! reads as a bright flat deck rather than as individual clouds. Structured
//! cloud geometry is not an option in this scene either: the camera far
//! plane is 900 m by default (`service::server::default_far`) and 2 km in
//! the lookdev lab, while the horizon distance of a 1 km cloud base is
//! ~110 km. A cloud dome would be clipped away everywhere except straight
//! overhead, which is worse than not having one.
