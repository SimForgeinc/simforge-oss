//! Reusable headless Bevy rendering engine for SimForge (`native` engine).
//!
//! Grown from scripts/renderer-spike/bevy-spike (GO verdict, FINDINGS.md):
//! DefaultPlugins minus Winit/Audio, no primary window, offscreen `Image`
//! render targets with GPU->CPU readback via copy_texture_to_buffer +
//! map_async. Unlike the spike CLI (which drives one App through a fixed
//! pose sequence), this module exposes a host-controlled [`SceneApp`]: the
//! owner calls [`SceneApp::render_once`] explicitly, which makes both the
//! job renderer and the long-lived service trivially sequential and
//! deterministic.
//!
//! Determinism contract (same construction rules as the spike):
//! MSAA Off, no temporal effects, deterministic instance-ID assignment
//! (meshes sorted by name then entity bits), fixed clear color, single
//! blocking readback per rendered frame.
//!
//! Lighting/profile routing: the scene is lit by the WSB4 lighting ladder
//! (`crate::lighting::spawn_lighting` — IBL sky, physical sun via the shared
//! spec docs/lighting-calibration.md) and every RGB camera gets its render
//! profile from `crate::profiles::RenderProfile::apply` (fixed EV100,
//! AgX cinematic stack, GTAO at rung ≥ 3). Temporal effects (TAA, motion
//! blur, auto-exposure) stay disabled: the host-driven single-step loop
//! renders exactly one frame per update.

/// * `star_gain` closes the star plate's arbitrary units against the site's
///   natural sky illuminance, then applies the declared display lift. The
///   lift is the night sky's long exposure: a single camera EV that prints a
///   3000 K street pool legibly puts a 22 mag/arcsec^2 sky, its skyglow and
///   its moonlit clouds several stops under black, so the sky's own
///   sources are lifted together (`night_lift`) and the lift is named
///   rather than hidden. It is invisible by day, where the atmosphere's
///   sky is thousands of times brighter than anything it multiplies.
/// * `moon_gain` is a pure energy closure: the disc integrates to the
///   resolved direct-normal illuminance over its own solid angle, which puts
///   a full Moon at roughly 4000 cd/m^2 without any authored number. The
///   disc is not lifted: it is already bright.
