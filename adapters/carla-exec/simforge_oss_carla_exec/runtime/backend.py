#: How each authored signal indication is realised on CARLA hardware.
#:
#: `carla.TrafficLightState` has exactly four renderable lamps
#: (Red/Yellow/Green/Off), so the eleven authored indications resolve onto them.
#: Its fifth member, `Unknown = 4`, is a readback sentinel rather than a lamp and
#: is never written; `bind_signals` captures whatever it reads as an opaque token
#: and restores it verbatim, so an `Unknown` read back from the runtime survives
#: the round trip without this table needing an entry for it.
#: This is not a lossy shortcut: a head's arrow/X glyph is hardware derived from
#: the plan's protected turns (`signal-head-model.ts`), never from the phase
#: word, so `green_arrow` genuinely *is* a green lamp on an arrow head. The
#: browser signal overlay (`scenario-xodr-tools/src/overlays/signals.ts`)
#: resolves the same eleven words onto the same colours, and renders the two
#: flashing indications by alternating against `off` — which is what the second
#: tuple element asks for here.

#: OpenSCENARIO `vehicleLightType` -> the `carla.VehicleLightState` members it

#: blinkers; emergency beacons use the vehicle's special-purpose channel. CARLA
#: has no daytime-running-lamp bit either, so `daytimeRunningLights` drives the
#: position-lamp channel, which is the closest thing it can actually render.
#:
#: Every entry here is deliberately DISJOINT from every other. `_apply_vehicle_lights`
#: iterates `sorted(lights)`, so overlapping bit sets would make the final mask
#: depend on the alphabetical order of the light-type names — `highBeam` sorts
#: before `lowBeam`, so a `low` beam setting expressed as overlapping masks
#: would be silently order-dependent. Keeping the sets disjoint means the writer
#: decides the beam combination and this table only translates it.

#: exports only `FL=0, FR=1, RL=2, RR=3, All=6`. The C++ enum does define
#: `Hood = 4, Trunk = 5` (`LibCarla/source/carla/rpc/VehicleDoor.h`), but
#: `PythonAPI/carla/src/Actor.cpp` exports only the five — an upstream binding
#: omission, not a UE5 regression. `carla.VehicleDoor(5)` would construct,
#: because boost::python enums accept arbitrary ints, but whether the UE5 asset
#: actually actuates a trunk is unverified, and a silent no-op in a paid render
#: is worse than refusing the scenario at export. So `doors.rear` is rejected by
#: the writer instead. `RL`/`RR` are genuinely available if the set-key schema
#: ever grows a rear-door distinction.
