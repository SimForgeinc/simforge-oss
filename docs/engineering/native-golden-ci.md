# Native golden store + regression gate (WSB6)

Status: implemented 2026-08-22. Enforces the byte-exactness policy measured and
documented in `determinism-claim.md` (WSB4): Bevy/wgpu sensor-profile
passes are byte-stable on one pinned GPU; Chrome RGB is provably not
goldenable (0/8 and 5/6 frames byte-equal) and is excluded from this suite.

## Components

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `qualification/golden-harness/golden.mjs` | record / verify CLI driving the native renderer binary |
| `qualification/golden-harness/scenes/*.json` | scene definitions (corpus files + renderer args + expected passes) |
| `qualification/golden-harness/goldens/<gpuFingerprint>/<scene>.json` | the golden store (committed) |
| `qualification/golden-harness/ci-local.sh` | local execution of the exact CI steps |
| `.github/workflows/native-golden.yml` | self-hosted 5080 runner workflow |

Renderer binary resolution order: `--bin` flag → `scene.binary` →
`renderer/target/release/native-render-job` (`renderer/render-core`). Scenes
with `rendererArgs` are turned into a `simforge.native-render-job/v1` job file
(one sensor camera per `cameras`, `frames` scheduled captures after `warmup`
warmup iterations); the hashed passes are the last scheduled frame's
`rgb.png` / `id.png` / `depth.f32.bin`. Every capture is a single GPU
submission with its copies ordered after the camera passes, so consecutive
frames never carry the previous frame's pixels. The former `native-render`
spike CLI (AgX output, unordered readback) is removed; goldens recorded
against it are retired and must be re-recorded (see `goldens/README.md`).

## GPU fingerprint policy

`gpuFingerprint` = first 16 hex of `sha256(canonical_json({gpus:[{name,
driverVersion, vbiosVersion, pciBusId}], kernel, arch}))`, with GPU facts from
the **same nvidia-smi query** as WSB4's
`qualification/render-determinism/gpu-fingerprint.mjs`
so fingerprint facts are comparable across Chrome evidence manifests and native goldens.
Rationale: same-device wgpu is empirically bitwise-stable; cross-driver/
cross-vendor equality is NOT claimed → goldens are keyed per fingerprint, never
universal. A new GPU/driver means: `record` on that host first, then verify.

## Golden store layout

```
goldens/<gpuFingerprint>/<scene>.json
```

The file is a full evidence manifest (below); the gates read `passHashes` and
`timings.avgFrameMs`. Committed to git so CI verifies against reviewed hashes.

## Manifest schema

Extends `simforge-oss.render-determinism-manifest.v1`; the top-level
`schema/generatedAt/claim/mode/scenario/rendererPath/hardware/verdict` keys stay
compatible. Additions:

    "frameTimeBudgetExceeded": false,
    "scope": "sensor-profile pass hashes, single GPU/driver/wgpu backend — cross-hardware reproducibility NOT claimed"
  }
}
```

Pass keys map to renderer outputs: `rgb0`→`<out>.rgb0.png`, `id0`→`<out>.id.png`,
`depth0`→`<out>.depth.f32.bin`, and (when WSB2 ships it) `mv0`→`<out>.mv.f32.bin`.
New passes = new key in `passFiles()` + `expectedPasses` in the scene JSON, then
re-record.

## Gates and exit codes

| Exit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | all passes match golden, frame-time within budget |
| 2 | pass-hash drift on any non-diagnostic pass |
| 3 | avg frame time regressed >10% vs recorded baseline (`GOLDEN_FRAME_BUDGET` overrides factor) |
| 4 | record-mode nondeterminism: two runs disagreed — no golden written |
| 5 | no golden exists for this GPU fingerprint — record first |
| 1 | environment/usage error (missing binary/corpus) |
| 6 | GPU busy — co-tenant load makes timings/hash evidence unreliable (`GOLDEN_GPU_WAIT` seconds to wait for a quiet window); CI sets it to 300 |

Record runs the scene twice and refuses to write a golden unless the two runs
agree byte-for-byte (the determinism evidence itself). Record/verify only run
on a quiet GPU (see exit 6): co-tenant load was measured to inflate frame
times ~5x (4 ms → 19 ms) and occasionally destabilize the lit RGB path. Verify runs once and
applies both gates. Frame-time uses the renderer-reported steady-state
`avg_frame_ms` over ≥30 measured frames after warmup.

## Measured findings baked into this gate (2026-08-22)

1. **Multi-GLB spawn-order hygiene fix.** `check_assets` spawned tile content as
   each GLB finished loading, so entity/draw order raced async load completion.
   Fixed to spawn only after all GLBs resolve, in CLI `--glbs` order
   (`renderer/render-core/src/bin/native-render.rs`; WSB2 notified).
2. **Residual rare RGB instability under co-tenant load.** Even after the fix,
   during heavy GPU sharing (load avg ~30, 10.6/16.3 GiB VRAM in use) ~1-in-10
   processes produced a second RGB population: the same 88 scattered pixels on
   one sunlit facade differing by 1–26 LSB. ID-slot and depth outputs were
   byte-identical in every observation (30+ runs); single-GLB scenes and
   sun-off (`--lux 0`) scenes were always stable. Not correlated with load
   level, frame parity, warmup, or codegen-units in controlled probes.
   Encoded here: record requires two agreeing runs (exit 4 otherwise); gates
   run only on a quiet GPU (exit 6). Escalated to WSB2/WSB4 (lit-path owners).
3. **id0 is currently vacuous.** Tracked spike source hardcodes
   `id_clones_done: true` at init — no ID clones are built, `.id.png` is solid
   background, no legend is written. The id0 hash stays gated (it will catch
   any accidental change) but carries no semantic evidence until WSB2
   re-enables clone building.
4. **Perf baselines are load-sensitive.** The recorded baseline (19.45 ms avg)
   was taken under co-tenant load; quiet-GPU steady state is ~4–5 ms (FINDINGS:
   4.33 ms). Re-record during a quiet window before trusting the +10% budget;
   exit 6 keeps CI off loaded windows.
5. **Lighting-independence expectation (stated policy).** depth0 (raw geometry)
   and id0 (unlit slot encoding) are expected to survive lighting/atmosphere
   changes, including WSB4's realism stack; only rgb0 is expected to drift when
   sensor-profile lighting changes. Verify reports per-pass verdicts so an rgb0
   re-record never masks an id0/depth0 regression.

## Golden lifecycle

Invalidation triggers — any of these means the golden must be re-recorded:
- `rendererPath.sha256` changes (new renderer binary; e.g. WSB5's job-mode
  binary uses Tonemapping::None while the spike CLI uses AgX — different RGB by
  construction, keyed separately).
- `corpusChecksums` change (spike corpus → WSB1 `.corpus/<mapId>/` decoded
  corpus alters texture/material sampling paths).
- `profile` / renderer-arg change (sun, EV100, weather, resolution, rig).
- WSB4 realism-stack landing: current yale-frame0 rgb0 golden
  (`e7185b3ae850c644…`) is **pre-realism-stack**; WSB4's default rung-2
  sensor lighting (IBL sky + 100k lux + fixed EV100) will invalidate it.

Re-record procedure:

```sh
cargo build --release -p render-core --bin native-render-job --manifest-path renderer/Cargo.toml
SIMFORGE_SENSOR_CORPUS=<corpus-root> node qualification/golden-harness/golden.mjs record yale-frame0
node qualification/golden-harness/golden.mjs verify all
```

Record appends the superseded golden to `previousVersions` in the stored JSON
(append-only), so rgb0 history is preserved across re-records and id0/depth0
lineage stays auditable. Scenes may carry `"extraArgs": [...]` appended
verbatim to the renderer invocation for forward-compatible flags (e.g.
WSB4's `--rung`, `--profile`, `--weather`).

## CI

`.github/workflows/native-golden.yml` targets `[self-hosted, Linux, X64,
gpu-rtx5080]`; jobs are serialized (`concurrency: native-golden-gpu`) because
the 5080 is shared. The runner itself may not be registered yet — until then
the workflow queues indefinitely; run `qualification/golden-harness/ci-local.sh`
locally (identical steps; log committed under
`qualification/golden-harness/evidence/`).
Registration steps are documented at the top of the workflow file.
