# Renderer contract v1 (`simforge.renderer-contract/v1`)

The renderer-neutral boundary between SimForge scene/session state and any
concrete renderer. It freezes the *shapes* that cross the boundary — camera
commands, actor frame batches, light state, picks, schedules, map
publications, semantic legends, artifact provenance — without rewriting any
working renderer internals.

Source of truth: `packages/viewer/src/renderer-contract.ts` (pure types +
normative pure functions, no `three` import, no runtime dependency).
Conformance evidence: `packages/viewer/src/renderer-contract.test.ts` against
`packages/viewer/fixtures/renderer-contract/basic-intersection.v1.json`,
executed through the Three adapter
(`packages/viewer/src/renderer-contract-adapter.ts`).

## Viewport ownership (frozen)

| Surface | Renderer | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Scenario editor + preview + quick VP9 recording | **Packaged Three WebGL** — `@simforge-oss/viewer` `CityViewer` + `ActorRenderer` | Canonical authoring viewport. Keeps custom picking, `G`/`R` modal manipulation, WebCodecs canvas recording. |
| City / digital-twin | **Platform Three WebGPU** — bespoke `city-viewer` runtime (platform repo) | Canonical map/twin surface. Streaming, TSL post stack, luminaires. |
| High-fidelity preview, sensor/dataset artifacts | **Native Bevy** — `renderer/{render-core,sensors,service}` | Canonical sensor/cinematic lane. Headless jobs + shm service; not a browser viewport. |

**There is no third browser viewport.** New browser render work lands in one
of the two existing Three surfaces; Bevy work lands in the native lane. A
Bevy WASM editor is gated behind the strategy-A feasibility spike and is out
of scope for this contract version.

### CityViewer map-loading observability

`CityViewerStats` reports implementation telemetry separately from the frozen
renderer wire contract. `downloads.transferredBytes` counts actual received
bytes, including external textures and startup metadata. `loadProgress`
reports the current stage and completed decode, texture-upload, and compile
counts; elapsed time alone is never progress.

Readiness requires road geometry and all wanted pinned coarse city tiles to
finish GPU preparation. `requiredPendingAssets` excludes optional refinements;
`requiredError` surfaces required download, decode, upload, compile, or memory
admission failures. A failed compile must not publish the asset as resident.
Consumers should poll from bootstrap start, use stage-specific idle deadlines
and an overall deadline, and report processing as indeterminate when no byte
denominator is available.

`textureMaxDimension` selects existing compressed mip levels before GPU upload;
it does not remove geometry or resample authored pixels. Embedders should pair
this limit with their quality preset's memory budget. It can change atomically
through `setAuthoringFidelity`; textures are cached separately by URL and mip
limit. Map changes renew the decoder's cancellation signal so an aborted prior
map cannot cancel the next map's texture requests.
If required coarse tiles cannot fit, the viewer estimates the full-map footprint
from resident tiles and lowers the mip ceiling in power-of-two steps, never
below 128 pixels. Geometry remains required. The effective limit is reported in
`loadProgress.textureMaxDimension`; a map that still cannot fit fails explicitly.
Each new map starts from the user's selected preset ceiling.

`resolveAssetUrls` optionally resolves a GLTF's external image URLs together
before texture loading. This lets authenticated embedders batch authorization
instead of serializing one database-backed request per image. Eight bounded
texture requests feed four transcoder workers; encoded unused mip levels are
removed before transcoding.

## Frozen wire identifiers

`scene-state.v1` and `uniscenario.static-semantics/v1` are referenced
byte-identically (see `docs/engineering/simcloud-sync.md`). Identifiers new
in this contract use the `simforge.` prefix:

- `simforge.renderer-contract/v1` — the contract version.
- `simforge.renderer-parity-fixture/v1` — the fixture document version.

## Contract surface

All coordinates are the y-up scene frame of scene-state.v1; metres, radians,
seconds. Matrices are 16 numbers, **column-major** (Three `Matrix4.elements`
order); row-major consumers own the transpose.

### Camera / view commands — `CameraCommand`, `CameraStateReport`

- `set-pose` — eye/target (+optional up). Formalizes `CameraView` /
  `CameraRig.applyView`.
- `set-intrinsics` — vertical FoV (deg), aspect, near, far. Pixel-focal
  consumers derive `fy = h / (2·tan(fovY/2))`, `fx = fy`, centred principal
  point.
- `frame` — explicit bounding sphere; the resulting pose is **normative**
  (`frameCameraPose`: fit the sphere in the smaller frustum axis, 15% pad,
  default azimuth π/4, elevation π/5) so framing is matrix-identical across
  renderers.
- `follow` — attachment (`actor` / `traffic-signal` / `map-feature`) +
  `chase`/`dash` mode; actor poses are normative (`followCameraPose`).
- `set-constraints-enabled` — sensor rigs temporarily own the exact eye below
  editor navigation limits (mirrors `setCameraPoseConstraintsEnabled`).

`CameraStateReport` returns pose, intrinsics, view matrix (world→camera) and
projection matrix (GL depth convention, [-1, 1]).

### Actor frame batches — `ActorFrameBatch`, `ActorRenderState`

`ActorRenderState` is the proven `ActorView` shape stated neutrally: id,
catalogId, ground-contact x/y/z, `headingRad` (CCW from +X about +Y), dims,
plus articulation/cue channels (doors, reversing, emergency, indicator,
headlights, bodyColor, animationTimeS, speedMps, downProgress). The Three
adapter compile-asserts `ActorRenderState` → `ActorView` assignability, so
the contract cannot drift from the renderer.

Batch semantics are **idempotent replace-all per layer** (`editor`,
`sumo-traffic`, renderer-local ids): the renderer draws exactly the batch,
matching `ActorRenderer.syncLayer`. Spawn/despawn is carried explicitly by
scene-state.v1 tick records; `actorRenderStateFromSceneState` is the
normative mapping from a scene-state actor tick (+ playback cues) to a
render state (`speedMps = |velocity|`, `animationTimeS = frame.t`).

### Light state — `LightStateReport`, `deriveVehicleLightStates`

Deterministic, renderer-portable rules (pinned to the Three implementation by
compile-time constant checks and the fixture test):

- Low beams: explicit per-actor `headlights` wins; otherwise the
  environment-driven global default (authored darkness). Emissive lenses are
  unbounded.
- Projected beams: at most `PROJECTED_HEADLIGHT_LIMIT = 8` real lights,
  chosen by ascending actor id.
- Street luminaires: bounded nearest-camera pool,
  `STREET_LUMINAIRE_ACTIVE_LIMIT = 12`.
- Emergency (`flashing`/`flashing_siren`), indicators
  (`left`/`right`/`hazard`), reverse panel: direct functions of the actor
  state.

### Picking — `PickRequest` → `PickResult`

Requests are NDC (+y up) against declared layers (`actors`, `ground`,
`map-static`). Hits are **id-based**: stable actor id or semantic instance
id, distance in metres, world-space point, optional semantic classification.
No `three` `Intersection`, no scene-graph object, ever crosses the boundary.
Light/cue volumes (low-beam lenses, emergency strobes, reverse panels) are
not selection targets.

### Fixed-step render schedule — `RenderSchedule`

`tickHz`, `startTick`, `frameCount`, exact backing-buffer size, pixel ratio
pinned to 1. `scheduleTimestampsMicros` yields the exact integer-microsecond
timestamps (WebCodecs/WebM timebase). A conforming renderer presents exactly
`frameCount` frames at these timestamps — the browser recorder's capture
manifest and a native render job share this schedule.

### Map publication — `MapPublicationDescriptor`

Manifest URL + `cacheVersion` (first 16 hex of sha256(manifest bytes) — the
existing asset-cache identity), schema version, optional full digest, static
semantics sidecar reference (`uniscenario.static-semantics/v1`), optional
asset variant. Browser renderers stream it; native renderers receive the same
publication resolved to absolute payloads. Identity is the digest, never a
mutable URL.

### Semantic legend — `SemanticLegend`

Static classes (the ten `uniscenario.static-semantics/v1` classes) and
scene-state actor classes are restated and pinned by test. Static instance
ids come from the published sidecar; actor instance ids are assigned
`1 + index` in ascending actor-id order (`actorInstanceLegend`) so ID passes
agree across renderers.

### Artifact provenance — `ArtifactProvenance`

Renderer identity (`three-webgl` / `three-webgpu` / `bevy-native`, version,
backend, device) plus input digests (scene-state, XODR, map cache version,
schedule) and a **determinism class**: `schedule-and-structure` (exact
schedule, container layout, ids, digests) or `byte-identical-pixels`.
Cross-GPU browser artifacts must claim `schedule-and-structure`; matching
input digests never imply pixel parity.

## Parity fixtures

`packages/viewer/fixtures/renderer-contract/*.json`
(`simforge.renderer-parity-fixture/v1`). Given the embedded scene-state.v1
document at tick `T` (+ playback cues + darkness default), a conforming
renderer must reproduce:

| Expectation | Tolerance |
|---|---|
| Camera view/projection matrices per camera case | abs ≤ `1e-6` per element |
| Actor body world transforms (position + yaw + dims/template scale, incl. gait offsets at `animationTimeS`) | abs ≤ `1e-6` per element |
| Vehicle light-on states + street-light pool config | exact |
| Semantic legend (classes, actor instance ids) | exact |
| Pick results (actor id per NDC ray; hit distance) | id exact; distance abs ≤ `1e-4` m |
| Schedule timestamps (µs) | exact integers |

Tolerances are f64-math tolerances, not pixel tolerances: the fixture pins
scene semantics, never GPU output. Regenerate after an *intentional*
behaviour change:

```
cd packages/viewer
REGEN_RENDERER_CONTRACT_FIXTURE=1 pnpm vitest run src/renderer-contract.test.ts
```

## Three adapter (compile-level proof, not a migration)

`ThreeRendererAdapter` wraps the narrow structural slice of `CityViewer`
(`ThreeAdapterHost`: camera, rig `getView`/`applyView`/`setEnabled`,
constraint toggle — the same structural trick as the editor's
`viewer-contract.ts`) plus an `ActorRenderer`. Compile-time proofs:

- `cityViewerAsAdapterHost`: `CityViewer` satisfies the host slice.
- `contractActorToView`: `ActorRenderState` is assignable to `ActorView`.
- `PROJECTED_HEADLIGHT_LIMIT` / `STREET_LUMINAIRE_ACTIVE_LIMIT` are pinned to
  `MAX_PROJECTED_HEADLIGHTS` / `DEFAULT_ACTIVE_LUMINAIRE_LIMIT` by typed
  constant assignment.

The adapter's light report is read from the *observed* renderer scene graph
(batch id bands, visible spotlights) and must equal the contract's normative
derivation — the fixture test asserts both.

## Public APIs this contract replaces at integration time (patch notes)

No implementation is migrated in v1. When a surface adopts the contract, the
following leaked-Three publics are superseded (replacement in parentheses):

- `CityViewer.scene` / `.camera` / `.renderer` / `.roadGroup` / `.cityGroup` /
  `.vegetationGroup` — mutable Three objects in the public API
  (→ `CameraCommand` / `CameraStateReport`; actor mounting via
  `ActorFrameBatch`; map layers via `MapPublicationDescriptor`).
- `CityViewer.controls: CameraRig` and `CameraRig.setView(Vector3, Vector3)`,
  `CameraPoseConstraint(PerspectiveCamera, Vector3)` (→ `set-pose` /
  `set-constraints-enabled`; `CameraView` capture stays, it is already
  neutral).
- Editor `EditorViewer` (`packages/editor/src/viewer-contract.ts`) exposing
  `Scene`/`PerspectiveCamera`/`renderer.domElement` (→ `ThreeAdapterHost`-
  style narrow slice + contract camera/pick channels).
- `Raycaster.setFromCamera` + `ActorRenderer.pickables()` +
  `actorIdForHit(Intersection)` call sites in editor/platform surfaces
  (→ `PickRequest`/`PickResult`; `actorIdForHit` remains internal to the
  Three adapter).
- `ActorRenderer.group` mounting into `viewer.scene` by platform code
  (→ adapter-owned mounting; frames via `applyActorFrame`).
- Ad-hoc light toggles (`setHeadlightsEnabled`, `setStreetLightsEnabled`)
  consumed cross-package (→ `LightStateReport` + environment default in the
  frame path).
- Sensor-capture camera re-posing that mutates Three cameras directly
  (→ `set-intrinsics`/`set-pose` with `set-constraints-enabled`).

Interior uses of Three inside a renderer are untouched — the contract governs
what crosses package/process boundaries, not how a renderer draws.
