## One-paragraph summary

SimForge is an open-source, deterministic ML training environment and CARLA
competitor. A portable scenario document and fixed-step TypeScript engine drive
Studio authoring, headless simulation, replay, native and web rendering, and
training environments without separate behavioral implementations. SimForge
Studio runs locally from `studio/` on port 5199; SimForge Cloud consumes the same
immutable 13-package stack. The Rust SimForge Renderer lives in `renderer/`,
and the CARLA execution adapter runs scenarios in a real CARLA runtime as the
reference workflow.
