# Local assets & the CARLA contract

SimForge's containerization rule, in one line: **the only container anywhere is
the user's CARLA base image; everything we develop runs outside containers, and
no large asset is ever baked into an image or committed to git.**

## Asset root

Pulled maps share one cache outside every repo and image:

```
${SIMFORGE_MAPS_CACHE_ROOT:-${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/simforge/maps}/
  dev-assets/<mapId>/       # semantic sidecars
  map-bundles/<mapId>/      # browser closure and external resources
  .corpus/<mapId>/          # native master closure
  .blobs/                   # content-addressed shared blobs
```


### Installed map profiles

`simforge maps pull <map>@<version>` materializes all three runtime profiles.
Each profile is activated only with a `.map-release.json` receipt that identifies
the same immutable registry release. The compiler and Studio discover complete
installations from the common cache; Studio publishes the browser closure and
registers the matching native master closure during normal boot.

Studio's seed treats an installation as complete when the three receipts name
one release (version, release digest, canonical digest, web digest), members
shared by the semantic and web profiles are byte-identical, the web profile
carries every browser publication member (`3d/manifest.json`, `map.xodr`,
`map.geojson.gz`, `topology-index.json.gz`, `lane-polygons.geojson.gz`,
`signals.geojson.gz`, `derived/topology-derived.json.gz`,
`derived/locations.json.gz`, `derived/roadway-consistency.json.gz`,
`derived/source-capabilities.json.gz`), and the native profile carries
`master.gltf`. Only what the registry publishes is required; build-only files
such as a map-intel build receipt are not. Published map-intel is projected from
the release's own reports the same way SimCloud projects a registry import: the
roadway audit must name the map and the closure's XODR/topology digests and is
published with its own verdict, and every `locations.json.gz` source hash must
equal the closure member it names. An incomplete installation is reported by
name and reason on the seed log and never replaced by a re-derived map.

`SIMFORGE_MAPS_CACHE_ROOT=/elsewhere` relocates the entire cache consistently.
Without that variable, `XDG_DATA_HOME` is honored and the fallback is
`~/.local/share/simforge/maps`. Do not point Studio at an individual profile.
When the cache has no complete installation, Studio uses its independently
generated Starter Road.

Rules:

- **Never** commit an asset from this tree into git (see `.gitignore` /
  `.gitattributes` guards) and **never** `COPY`/`ADD` one into a Dockerfile.
- New asset classes get a manifest entry with a real digest *before* code
  starts depending on them. Entries whose bytes are not yet published carry
  `"url": null` and are reported honestly as missing/pending by `status` —
  they are never silently faked.

## CARLA: user-provided, never ours to ship

CARLA is **user-provided**. Users run CARLA themselves as their own container,
a normal upstream-style distribution **with maps baked inside** (e.g.
`ghcr.io/simforgeinc/carla-rr-maps:0.10.0`). SimForge does **not** package,
rebuild, redistribute, or manage CARLA or its map content in any way:

- We build **no** image `FROM` a CARLA image (this is the *only* container in
  the whole system, and it is not ours).
- We bake **no** SimForge code into it — `adapters/carla-exec` installs on the
  host (`pip install`) and **connects** to the already-running server.
- We bind-mount nothing into it and own no part of its content lifecycle.

The connection contract is:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SIMFORGE_CARLA_HOST` | `localhost` | RPC host of the user's running CARLA server |
| `SIMFORGE_CARLA_PORT` | `2000` | RPC port (`PORT..PORT+2` in use) |

If nothing answers there, the adapter fails preflight with a clear message —
*start your CARLA container first* — instead of attempting any container
lifecycle management.

### Optional developer convenience

`scripts/assets/carla-up.sh` exists purely to save local-dev keystrokes:
it attaches when a server already answers on `SIMFORGE_CARLA_HOST:PORT`,
starts a stopped container, or `docker run`s the pinned user-provided image
with `-RenderOffscreen`. It **refuses to build images** (exit 3 on any
`build` argument) and errors out when the image is absent rather than
pulling content on your behalf. It is not part of the product contract.

## Developer loop (CARLA path)

```
scripts/assets/carla-up.sh        # once per boot; the container is long-lived
# edit python in adapters/carla-exec/ ...
python -m pytest adapters/carla-exec/tests -q        # pure-python, no server needed
simforge-oss-carla-exec <cmd> --host localhost --port 2000  # rerun against the live server
```

No image build, no container restart, no asset copy is ever part of the
edit-run loop.
