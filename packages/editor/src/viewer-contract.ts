/**
 * The editor core's contract with whatever 3D surface it is driving.
 *
 * The core used to `import` this from the WebGL renderer, which is what forced
 * the renderer to be a workspace package in the first place. The real coupling
 * was never structural: six of the seven references were `import type` (erased
 * at compile time) and the seventh was a single string constant. So the contract
 * lives here instead, stated as the *narrowest* surface the core actually
 * touches — `scene`, `camera`, `renderer.domElement`, and four `controls`
 * methods.
 *
 * Consequence worth keeping: any viewer that satisfies this shape can host the
 * editor. `CityViewer` (`../renderer`) satisfies it structurally without
 * declaring so, and nothing in this directory imports the renderer.
