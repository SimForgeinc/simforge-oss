/**
 * Which way an actor goes through a junction, and who is allowed to guess.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * Every place that has to continue an actor past a branch — the browser
 * preview's corridor resolver, the route compiler, anything that walks lane
 * successors — answers the same question, and it has exactly one answer:
 *
 * 1. **An explicit route anchor.** The author drew where the car goes; nothing
 *    else gets a say. This is not resolved here — it is resolved by routing
 *    through the anchors — but it is first, and `junctionDirectionPolicy`
 *    reports it so a caller cannot skip it by accident.
 * 2. **A `turn_at_next_intersection` clip.** The author said "turn left at the
 *    next one" and did not say where; that direction governs the first branch
 *    and only the first.
 * 3. **Straight.** Which way a particular car should go is authoring intent and
 *    no part of the map can supply it, so for a car somebody placed the only
 *    honest default is to keep going. "Keep going" IS in the data: it is the
 *    branch whose heading changes least.
 *
 * The one exception is PROCEDURALLY GENERATED ambient traffic — the vehicles
 * `expandRandomTrafficActors` synthesizes inside a random-traffic region. Those
 * have no author to have an intention, and a lane full of them that all pick the
 * same exit collapses into single file, so they draw from `JUNCTION_TURN_WEIGHTS`.
 *
 * `role: "traffic"` is NOT that exception and was briefly used as if it were.
 * It is the DEFAULT role on the draft schema, so every hand-placed car that was
 * not promoted to ego carried it: cars the author had positioned by hand went on
 * taking weighted-random turns, which is the report the scoping was meant to fix
 * ("it turns right even though I just want it to go straight").
 *
 * ## Classifying a branch
 *
 * From geometry, because the runtime bundle's topology edges carry no turn
 * relation. `junctionTurnForBranch` measures the approach's heading against
 * where the candidate has GOT TO, and on real OpenDRIVE geometry that reproduces
 * the `TopologyGate.turnRelation` the map's own index stamps.
 *
 * The obvious cheaper measure — the approach's heading against the candidate's
 * FIRST TWO VERTICES — does not work at all. Lane centerlines are sampled at
 * about a metre, and a junction connector leaves the stop line pointing the same
 * way the approach did: measured on the Belmont Research Center map, five
 * connectors the map records as 56°–119° turns all read between -0.4° and 0.0°.
 * Every branch classified as straight, so the weights were uniform and
 * "straightest" was a coin toss decided by float dust.
