/**
 * Step automatically through a dataset's scenarios — the review loop.
 *
 * **Reshaped from v1, and the difference matters.** v1's `useDatasetScenarioAutoplay` pressed play on a
 * *simulation*: it waited for a map-settle window, checked that the staged frames came from the draft
 * actually open, and refused when a saved worker timeline was queued for the same window. It could do
 * that because v1 had a browser preview engine to press play on.
 *
 * v2 has no playback engine yet — preview simulation is a later wave (manifest §7, items 123–133). So
 * autoplay here advances the *selection* on a dwell rather than driving a clip, which is the part of
 * the review loop that works today: the reviewer rates, autoplay moves on. Two properties from v1 are
 * kept because they are what makes it usable rather than annoying:
 *
 * - It stops at the end rather than wrapping. A loop that silently restarts makes a reviewer lose
 *   their place in a long dataset.
 * - It pauses on `document.hidden`, so a backgrounded tab does not burn through the queue unseen.
 *
 * When the preview engine lands, the gate belongs here: hold the dwell until the clip has actually
 * played once, instead of advancing on wall-clock.
