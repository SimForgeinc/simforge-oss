/**
 * Runtime owner of the cinematic camera on the list surface.
 *
 * ## One camera, one owner
 *
 * Three things can move the list camera: the idle street tour, the single-actor
 * framing transition, and now the director. They cannot overlap — a shared
 * viewer with two writers produces a camera that visibly fights itself, which is
 * exactly why `useScenarioSession` pins the playback policy to `free` and
 * warns against auto-framing during authoring. The invariant is enforced by the
 * call sites: the tour runs only without a selected document, the director only
 * with one, and the framing transition is the at-rest pose the director replaces
 * while it is engaged.
 *
 * The director writes through `viewer.applyView`, the same channel the framing
 * transition on this surface already uses, rather than a `PlaybackController`
 * camera policy. Policies hold one sustained composition; this needs to cut.
 *
 * ## Release on touch
 *
 * A preview that fights the mouse is worse than no preview. Any pointer, wheel,
 * or key interaction hands the camera back for `RESUME_IDLE_MS`, after which the
 * director picks the current shot back up mid-clip — the same contract as the
 * street tour's `interruptible`.
