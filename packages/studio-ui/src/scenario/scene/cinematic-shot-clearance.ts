/**
 * Azimuth search for an unobstructed shot.
 *
 * ## Why an analytic camera is not enough
 *
 * The director solves its azimuth from the interaction sightline, which on a
 * real city map is frequently occupied by a building, a bus shelter, or street
 * trees. The offline exporter hit exactly this and answered it with
 * `CAMERA_SEARCH_OFFSETS` in `scripts/export-render.mjs`: orbit the fitted
 * camera around its own target until every framing actor has line of sight, and
 * keep the accepted offset sticky so the shot does not jitter frame to frame.
 * Its authoritative check, `inspectIncidentComposition`, raycast from the eye to
 * each actor through the static city and vegetation layers — which is what this
 * module does against the same two groups.
 *
 * The offline version re-ran the search per frame, each candidate paying a
 * `waitForStreamIdle` and a settle: seconds of work per still. Real-time
 * playback cannot afford that, so the search runs **once per shot** when the
 * shot becomes active and its result is reused for the shot's whole window.
 *
 * This is the only part of the director that touches the scene graph, which is
 * why it lives apart from the pure solver.
