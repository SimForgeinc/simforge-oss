/**
 * The signals lane's registration into the timeline dock.
 *
 * ## One lane per junction
 *
 * `laneId` is `signal:junction:<junctionId>`, and there is exactly one plan per
 * junction — `compileMapSignalPlans` replaces a junction's programs wholesale per
 * plan, and `upsertMapSignalPlan` keys on the junction for that reason. So a
 * duplicate registration is a real bug and `createTimelineLaneRegistry`'s throw
 * is the correct response, not something to defend against.
 *
 * Per-stage detail goes **inside `datum`** via `buildStageTimelineRows`, not as
 * extra lanes. Eight rows for an ordinary four-way would bury the actor lanes,
 * and the expanded view is a disclosure on one lane rather than eight lanes that
 * are usually collapsed.
 *
 * ## `spans` is a pull, and that is what keeps the direction one-way
 *
 * The dock asks "what is in this window"; it never subscribes to signal
 * internals and never reimplements phase evaluation. Signals import the registry;
 * the registry imports nothing from signals.
