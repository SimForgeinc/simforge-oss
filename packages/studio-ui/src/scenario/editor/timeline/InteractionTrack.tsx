/**
 * One interaction drawn as a bar on the shared time axis — manifest 84.
 *
 * The bar's *appearance* carries what the static analysis could and could not determine, because those
 * are different claims and drawing them identically is a lie the author cannot detect:
 *
 * - a solid bar is an exact start and an authored end;
 * - a dashed left edge means `armed` — the start on screen is the earliest instant it *could* fire, not
 *   a time anything claims. A condition trigger, a back-solved arrival, or an expression reading a
 *   site fact no template knows yet;
 * - a faded right edge means `openEnded` — no `until` was authored, so it runs until something preempts
 *   it or the clip ends. The bar reaching the right edge is not an authored value.
 *
 * A zero-width bar is a real state, not a bug: an `until` earlier than its own trigger collapses to
 * nothing, and the validator reports it as `until_before_trigger`. `min-w-px` keeps it visible so the
 * author can find the row the error names.
