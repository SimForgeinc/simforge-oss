 * Keep the translucent placement ghost off screen when nothing is being placed.

 * with `ghost.group.visible = !active`, unconditionally — it does not ask
 * whether placement is armed. `cancelModal()` hides the ghost but keeps its
 * meshes, catalog and last pose, which after a placement is the pose of the car
 * that was just dropped. So every later "editor is presenting again" toggle
 * (leaving playback, the surface becoming active, opening a route from the
 * timeline) re-shows a green ghost sitting exactly on top of that car, and it
 * stays until something happens to hide it again.
 *
 * That is why it reads as "the car I clicked is highlighted green as if I were
 * still placing it", and why it only happens after a placement.
 *
 * The real repair belongs in `editor-core`, which owns the ghost and knows the
 * mode; the platform consumes a hash-verified vendored build of that package,
 * so the surface re-asserts the invariant instead.
