/**
 * Keep the camera looking at a moving actor.

 * Clicking a car mid-playback used to fly once to wherever it happened to be and
 * stop, so by the time the flight settled the car had driven out of frame. This
 * follows it instead, and does so by translating the whole rig: every frame the
 * offset between camera and orbit target is read back from the controls and
 * reapplied to the actor's live position, so distance and angles are whatever
 * the author last set. We never recompute a framing distance here — that is what
 * `flyCameraTo` is for, and doing it while tracking would yank the zoom out from
 * under the author.
 *
 * Reading the offset live rather than capturing it once is what lets the author
 * keep orbiting and dollying while the car moves: their gesture rotates around
 * the target we just set, which is the car, and the next frame preserves the
 * angle they landed on.
 *
 * The first `FLIGHT_MS` ease the look-at point over from wherever it was so the
 * pick does not snap; because the offset is preserved throughout, that ease is a
 * translation and not an orbit change.
 *
 * `resolveTarget` returning null means the actor has no on-screen pose — it has
 * despawned, or playback moved past its window. The camera then holds still
 * rather than diving to the origin, and picks the actor up again if it returns.
