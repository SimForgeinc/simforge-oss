 * 1,940 B — measured, 121x. All 859 of Belmont's stalls would now be 1.81 MiB
 * against a 64 MiB plan ceiling, so roughly 34,000 cars would fit.
 *
 * What remains is simulation and CARLA spawn cost. A static actor skips motion
 * integration, routing, signals, and static/static collision pairs, but it still
 * occupies a slot in the actor array, the collision broadphase, and one trace
 * sample per fixed step — and a CARLA render has to spawn every one of them.
 * Neither cost is measured here, so this is a deliberate guard rather than a
 * measured ceiling: 250 covers a large lot several times over while keeping the
 * blast radius of "fill every stall on the map" bounded.
 *
 * Applied to the plan, not to baking, so the preview never shows cars an export
 * would drop.
