/**
 * Catalog vocabulary.
 *
 * ## Conventions every builder in this package obeys
 *
 * - **Units**: metres. Every dimension is the real-world dimension of the thing
 *   being represented; semantic correctness beats visual fidelity.
 * - **Frame**: y-up (the scene frame `city-renderer` and `xodr-tools` use).
 *   `+X` is the object's facing / run direction, `+Z` is its left-to-right
 *   extent. A vehicle drives towards `+X`; a sign faces `+X`; a barrier or
 *   hedge *run* extends along `+X`.
 * - **Origin**: ground-centre. The bounding box of a built prop is centred on
 *   the origin in X and Z and starts at `y = 0` (wheels/feet/base touch the
 *   ground plane), so placement is `group.position.set(x, groundY, z)` plus a
 *   yaw about Y — no per-prop offsets to remember. The one exception is
 *   declared, never inferred: an entry with `origin: 'body-centre'` is a
 *   rigid-body component whose mesh is centred on the origin in all three
 *   axes, because a physics solver exports that body's centre pose (position
 *   plus full quaternion) and the renderer must place the mesh at it verbatim.
 * - **Dims**: `l` is the extent along X, `w` along Z, `h` along Y.
