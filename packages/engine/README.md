# @simforge-oss/engine

All simulation runs the force-based `dynamic-v1` backend; it is the only
motion backend. `kinematic-v1`, the choreography model it replaced, survives
only as a recorded mode so immutable legacy traces still replay. Validation
scope, performance gates, and current non-claims are documented in
[`../../docs/engineering/physics-validation.md`](../../docs/engineering/physics-validation.md).

Layer 3 of `docs/agent-authoring-architecture.md`: the deterministic scenario
simulation engine. This package is the **host-neutral contract** of that engine:
the `SimScenarioInput` authoring schema (`zod`), the trace/metrics/evaluation
and scene-state document types, ambient-traffic profiles, the SUMO interchange
helpers and pure hashing. **The engine itself executes only in the native
runtime** (`@simforge-oss/native-runtime`: N-API addon in Node, WASM in the
browser). There is no TypeScript simulator, materialiser or evaluator behind any
export here; the two host entries bind the same façade to the two runtimes.

```ts
// Node: the N-API addon, loaded on first use.
import { buildLaneGraph, parseTrace, runSimulation } from '@simforge-oss/engine/node';

const graph = buildLaneGraph(topologyIndexJson); // dev-assets/<map>/topology-index.json.gz
const { trace, issues, arrival } = runSimulation(doc, { graph }); // doc is validated natively
const verdict = parseTrace(trace).evaluate(); // 'accept' | 'reject' + findings
```

```ts
// Browser: the initialised WASM module. No Node builtin is reachable from here.
import { loadEngine } from '@simforge-oss/engine/browser';

const engine = await loadEngine(); // EngineRuntime over the WASM module
const graph = engine.laneGraph(topologyIndexBytes);
const result = engine.run(doc, { graph });
```

`EngineRuntime` is the one façade both entries construct: `laneGraph`,
`scenario`, `run`, `checkFeasibility`, `trace` (a `TraceHandle` with `evaluate`,
`sceneState`, `digest`, `evaluateIntentRubric`, `blindReviewPacket`,
`checkInvariants`), `replayWorldLog`. Every call crosses into the native module
and returns owned typed arrays or parsed JSON documents.

## The seam: `SimScenarioInput`

`SimScenarioInput` is a **fully resolved concrete scenario**. No logical
anchors, no parameter references, no expressions, no map queries — every actor
already has a pose, a route and numeric rules; every trigger already has numeric
thresholds. Producing one from a `ScenarioTemplate` v2 (site match + parameter
draw + expression evaluation) is the *adapter's* job, in another package. This
type is the stable target that adapter builds against.

```
SimScenarioInput
  schemaVersion, mapId, clipSeconds=20, warmupSeconds=5, dt=0.02, seed
  metricSubject?                       ← which actor the metrics are about
  actors[]      { id, kind: vehicle|pedestrian, dims{l,w,h},
                  initial { laneRef?{rsl,s,tFrac}, pose{x,z,headingRad}, speedMps },
                  behavior { rules{obeySignals,yield,collisionAvoidance,
                                   aggression,speedFactor},
                             route: RouteSpec, cruiseSpeedMps? },
                  presentAtStart, tags[] }
  interactions[]{ id, actorId, trigger, <verb>, dynamics?, until? }
  signalPrograms[]{ id, phases[{phase,durationS}], offsetS, loop,
                    stopLines[{rsl,s,connectingLaneRsls[]}],
                    mapBinding?{junctionId,controllerIds[],headIds[],timingSource} }
  occluders[]   { id, obb{center,lengthM,widthM,headingRad,heightM} }
```

**Seven verbs over five axes** (exactly the research doc's vocabulary):

| verb | axis | shape |
|---|---|---|
| `speed` | longitudinal | `target: absolute \| delta \| factor \| match \| stop` |
| `gap` | longitudinal | `target{actorId}, value, mode: time \| distance` |
| `changeLane` | lateral | `target: left \| right \| lane \| actorLane` |
| `laneOffset` | lateral | `target{mode: meters \| fraction, value}` |
| `route` | topology | `target: RouteSpec` |
| `exist` | existence | `target{state: present \| absent}` |
| `set` | discrete state | `target{key, value}` over the typed key registry |

`dynamics = {shape: step|linear|sinusoidal|cubic, constraint: rate|time|distance,
value}` is **mandatory** on every shaped verb — never defaulted.

**Triggers**: `at(t)` · `after(id, delayS)` · `when(condition, byLatest,
ifNever: skip|fire)` · `arrival({of, at, syncWith, ttc|deltaT})`. `byLatest` is
mandatory on `when`, because a condition that never fires is a silent bug.
Conditions: `distance` (alongLane|euclidean), `ttc`, `headway`, `reaches`
(circle | polygon | lane s-window), `speed`, `standstill`, `signal`, `collision`,
`visible(a, to: b)`, and shallow `and`/`or`/`not`.

**One axis, one owner; later preempts earlier.** A newly fired interaction
replaces whatever held its axis and emits a `preemption` event. No priorities,
no nesting. `set` owns one axis *per key*, so unrelated state writes coexist.

## Coordinate frames

The engine computes entirely in the **xodr-local** frame — `x` east, `y` north,
metres, headings CCW from `+x` — because that is the frame the topology index's
lane polylines already use, so route arc length and OBB overlap need no per-tick
transform.

| surface | frame |
|---|---|
| `SimScenarioInput` poses, points, occluder OBBs | **scene** `{x, z}` (y-up) |
| everything inside the engine | **xodr-local** `{x, y}` |
| `SimTrace.ticks` (`header.frame === 'xodr-local'`) | **xodr-local** `{x, y}` |

`scene = (x, 0, −y)`, and `headingRad` is numerically identical in both. Use
`localFromScene` / `toSceneXZ`, or `traceToSceneFrame(trace)` for a wholesale
conversion. See `src/frames.ts`.

## Lane graph: why orientation is derived

`topology-index.json.gz` stores lane polylines in geometric `s` order and its
`predecessors`/`successors` lists are effectively **undirected** — on
yale-street, 658 of 1534 links fail a naive "my last point is your first point"
test, and many lanes list the same neighbour in both arrays. So `LaneGraph`
works with directed lanes (`{rsl, reversed}`) and derives successors
*geometrically*: a neighbour qualifies when one of its admissible orientations
starts within `ENDPOINT_TOL_M` (0.5 m) of our exit point. Non-junction lanes are
pinned to their sign-implied OpenDRIVE direction so the walker cannot drive the
wrong way; junction connecting lanes are free, resolved by the approach they
were entered from. 93 % of yale-street's driving lanes get a directed successor;
the rest are genuine map-boundary dead ends.

## Trace

Gzipped canonical JSON, columnar per actor:

```
header  { engineVersion, inputHash, seed, mapId, topologyDigest, dt,
          clipSeconds, warmupSeconds, frame: 'xodr-local', actorIds[], metricSubject }
ticks   { t[], actors{ id → { x[], y[], headingRad[], speedMps[], laneRsl[], s[], present[] } } }
events  trigger_fired | trigger_skipped | preemption | released | lane_change |
        lane_change_rejected | collision | spawn | despawn | state_set
metrics { minTTC{value,t,pair}, minDistance[], requiredDecelMax{},
          revealToConflict?, collisions[], triggerNeverFired[],
          clippedCriticality, ticksSimulated }
```

Only `t ∈ [0, clipSeconds]` is recorded; the warm-up prologue is excluded by
construction, and the sample at `t = 0` *is* the prologue's final state.

## Determinism

Bit-identical traces for identical inputs, and identical traces for inputs that
differ only in declaration order. Enforced by: sorted iteration at every fan-out,
a plan/apply split so no actor reads a neighbour that has already stepped,
integer-indexed time (`t = (i − warmupTicks) · dt`, never accumulated), a seeded
xoshiro128\*\* instead of `Math.random`, and channel quantisation before
serialisation - all inside `simforge-core`. The Node and WASM builds of the same
Rust engine produce byte-identical traces for the same input and map.

## Performance

Build the `LaneGraph` once and share it across runs: it is a native handle, and
every session, batch and whole-clip run built from it shares the decoded map.
Whole-clip runs are synchronous by design; the consumer decides threading
(`worker_threads` in the CLI batch, the runner for durable jobs).

## Default dynamic-v1 motion

`physics: { mode: 'dynamic-v1' }` explicitly pins the force-based motion
backend for forward `car` and generic `vehicle` actors. It uses deterministic
5 ms substeps by default and records body velocity, yaw rate, steering, wheel
speed, axle loads and tyre utilization alongside solver provenance. The
scenario layer still owns targets and safety decisions; a speed controller and
preview path tracker turn those targets into throttle, brake and steering.

This is one calibrated generic passenger-car model, not vehicle-specific
parameter identification and not a CARLA-equivalence claim. It has planar body
dynamics, actuator lag, aerodynamic/rolling resistance, quasi-static
longitudinal axle load transfer, combined-slip axle friction circles, a
per-class automatic gearbox with a torque curve, and rigid collision impulses.
It does not model suspension, pitch/roll/heave, individual wheels, ABS/ESC or
road grade.

`dynamic-v1` is the only motion backend. Omitting `physics` resolves to it,
and a document that pinned the removed `kinematic-v1` choreography model
migrates to it when parsed — no feature is lost, since authored routes and
freehand timed polylines are executed as the path tracker's targets and speed
profile. Existing verified evidence is still replayed from its recorded
provenance, which is where `kinematic-v1` survives as a recorded mode.

## Deliberate simplifications

Stated plainly, because they bound what a metric from this engine means:

- **TTC is the closing-speed form** (`gap / closing speed along the line of
  centres`) using circumscribed radii, not OBBs. Exact for rear-end and head-on
  geometries; conservative and slightly under-reporting for crossing ones. A
  true path-intersection TTC needs `map-intel`'s junction `conflictPairs`, which
  this package deliberately does not depend on.
- **`rules.yieldToVehicles` / `rules.yieldToPedestrians` use a coarse
  crossing-path scan** (14 samples at 5 m, 2.5 m proximity, 2.5 s arrival
  window, ignored below a 0.4 rad heading difference so car-following is not
  double-counted) rather than a precomputed conflict-point table. Which switch
  applies is decided by the *other* actor's class. Enough to make junction
  behaviour sensible; not a substitute for the real table when that lands.
- **Line of sight is a 2-D ground-plane test.** Occluder heights are carried but
  unused — reveal-to-conflict is dominated by plan-view geometry, and a 3-D test
  would need render meshes.
- **The gap controller is a PD loop, not IDM.** Its equilibrium gap equals the
  commanded gap *exactly*, unlike IDM's `1/√(1−(v/v₀)⁴)` offset, which matters
  when a scenario declares "2.0 s headway" and a filter later checks it.
- **`lights.*`, `doors.*`, `pose.*`, `env.*` are recorded state only.** They
  land in `stateKeys` and the event log for the renderer and exporter; no
  controller consumes them yet.
- **`metrics.invariantResiduals` is typed but not populated** — invariants live
  in the template layer; `TraceHandle.checkInvariants(template, …)` evaluates
  them natively in the compiler against the declared template.
- **The whole-clip runway guard applies to vehicles on lane routes only.**
  Pedestrians and freeform paths are *supposed* to finish mid-clip, and an actor
  the scenario explicitly despawns is exempt.
