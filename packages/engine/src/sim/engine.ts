/**
 * The deterministic fixed-step simulation loop.
 *
 * ## Tick order (this *is* the determinism contract)
 *
 * 1. Detect OBB overlaps → the tick's collision set.
 * 2. Evaluate triggers in **sorted interaction-id order**; fire, preempt, skip.
 * 3. Evaluate `until` conditions; release axes.
 * 4. **Plan** every actor from the same frozen snapshot (sorted actor-id order).
 * 5. **Apply** all plans.
 * 6. Retire actors that ran out of route.
 * 7. Record the tick when `t ≥ 0`.
 *
 * Planning and applying are separate passes so no actor ever reads a neighbour
 * that has already stepped — the result is independent of actor declaration
 * order, which `determinism.test.ts` proves by permuting the input.
 *
 * Time is computed as `(i - warmupTicks) * dt` from an integer index rather
 * than accumulated, so `t = 0` is exact and floating-point drift cannot shift a
 * trigger by a tick.

   * car takes an impulse of the same order, but it only arrests momentum the
   * walker already had — a bump, not a knockdown — while a car striking a
   * standing pedestrian adds all of it. Comparing planar speed across the
   * contact separates the two without needing contact normals, and it keeps the
   * threshold in the units it is argued in: the sideways velocity a person can
   * still recover their balance from.
