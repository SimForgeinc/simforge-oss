/**
 * Published JSON Schemas for v2 — three of them, on purpose.
 *
 * The whole template is one document, but agents do not emit whole documents in
 * one shot, and constrained decoding works best against the smallest schema
 * that describes what is being produced right now. The generation pipeline in
 * the architecture doc emits an anchor first (that is the hard part, and the
 * part where hallucinated road ids would do the most damage), then a timeline
 * against the roles it just declared. So:
 *
 * - `scenario-template.v2.schema.json` — the whole document, for validators and
 *   for editors with `$schema` autocomplete;
 * - `logical-anchor.v2.schema.json` — **the LLM emission target**. Flat,
 *   enum-heavy, no coordinates expressible;
 * - `interactions.v2.schema.json` — the timeline alone, for the second call.
 *
 * `io: 'input'` throughout: the files describe what may be *written*, where
 * defaults are optional and expressions may still be strings.
 *
 * Cross-field rules that JSON Schema cannot express are listed in each
 * `description` rather than silently dropped — a model reading the schema sees
 * "dynamics is required for speed/gap/changeLane/laneOffset" even though the
 * schema itself only makes it optional.
