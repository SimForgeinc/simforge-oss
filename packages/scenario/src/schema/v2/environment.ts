/**
 * Layer 5 of the PEGASUS stack: environment as variation axes.
 *
 * Presets rather than free numbers, because the renderer, the friction model
 * and the sensor model all have to agree on what "heavy rain" means; a preset
 * is a name they can each resolve, a raw `rainIntensity: 0.63` is three
 * independent guesses. The numeric fields exist for the cases where the
 * *criticality* depends on the exact value (sun-azimuth glare, friction) and
 * they accept expressions, so `env.frictionScale = param.friction` makes
 * friction a first-class sampled axis.
 *
 * `extensions` keeps this block genuinely extensible: a renderer-specific knob
 * lands there without a schema version bump, and nothing in this package reads
 * it.
