/**
 * "Which lane is this world point on?" — the missing inverse for every reader
 * that has a position but needs a lane id.
 *
 * The motivating case was the (since retired) .xosc importer. The writer emits
 * absolute world positions and never `LanePosition` (road ids renumber across UE5 map
 * rebuilds), so an exported file carries no lane ids at all — and without them
 * a reader cannot tell the travel frame from the reference-line frame, which
 * is the difference between a left swerve and a right one. The topology index
 * has the missing half: sampled lane centerlines in the same runtime-world
 * metres the writer emits.
 *
 * ## Nearest centreline, and deliberately no heading gate
 *
 * The obvious refinement — reject lanes whose stored centreline runs opposite
 * to the entity's heading — is WRONG here, and measurably so. Positive-id lane
 * centrelines are stored against the direction of travel (the same convention
 * `laneFrameSign` exists for; measured 195/195 on Munich and 342/342 on
 * Belmont in the XODR, and confirmed independently in the topology index: both
 * Munich actors spawn at heading 163.0 deg on lanes whose polylines run at
 * -16.9 deg, a dot product of exactly -1.000). A naive heading gate therefore
 * throws away the correct lane and reaches for a distant one: on Munich it
 * picked a lane 93.59 m away with the WRONG SIGN, which is the one error that
 * actually matters.
 *
 * Measured over the five E7 campaign maps (10 actors, ground truth from each
 * authored draft's `spawn.lane_id`): nearest-centreline gets the lane SIGN
 * right 10/10; a naive heading gate 9/10; a heading gate corrected for the
 * convention 10/10 — i.e. identical to plain nearest, for more code. So the
 * heading is used only to REPORT disagreement (`headingAgrees`), never to
 * filter.
 *
 * ## What this is accurate to
 *
 * Lane SIGN, which is all `laneFrameSign` consumes, was exact on all ten. The
 * exact lane ORDINAL was right on nine: Richmond's B resolves to lane -1 at
 * 0.1005 m where its draft records -2. That is not necessarily a resolver
 * error — an authored `spawn.lane_id` and a current topology index can come
 * from different map builds, which is the very renumbering the writer's
 * world-position policy exists to dodge. Treat the ordinal as advisory and the
 * sign as reliable.
