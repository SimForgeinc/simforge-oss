/**
 * Junction markers on the map (plan 2026-07-24 §4.3, extended by the
 * intersection-control plan 2026-07-26 §7.1).
 *
 * Two states that must not look alike:
 *
 * - **Controlled** — an authored plan the author placed. A solid disc in the
 *   live dominant colour with a white ring and a mode chip. It never hides at
 *   any zoom, because it is authored content.
 * - **Uncontrolled but signalized** — a hollow ring at low opacity, hidden below
 *   zoom 13. Context, not content.
 *
 * They used to be the same disc with different fills, which is not enough
 * separation to answer "which of these did I author?".
 *
 * Store-driven rather than prop-driven: this layer lives inside the shared map
 * component but its data is editor state, and threading it down the editor's
 * prop chain would add an entry to five component signatures for a layer that
 * renders nothing outside the editor. Outside the editor the stores are empty
 * and the layer returns null.
 *
 * A `Marker` rather than a MapLibre symbol layer because the glyph is a small
 * interactive control (the `WorldSensorLayers` idiom): the disc IS the click
 * target, so it needs real DOM rather than a `queryRenderedFeatures` hit-test
 * added to the map's already long click chain. It is also what lets the editing
 * card anchor to it — `data-junction-marker-id` is a real node in 2D and in 3D.
