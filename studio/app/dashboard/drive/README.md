# Drive

A real in-memory scenario editor whose compiled 20-second scenario can be driven
interactively. Drive reuses the scenario editor's document, controller, actor
library, inspector, header, and timeline rather than maintaining parallel UI.

## Shape

```
page.tsx ─ requireAppContext, then DriveClient
DriveClient.tsx ─ composes the real editor regions:
   EditorHeader          shared authoring header and viewport settings
   ActorLibraryRail      controller-backed actor and environment placement
   EditorOverlayHost     selected-actor details
   ScenarioTimelineDock  authored actor lanes and world transport
   CityView              map and authored/live actor rendering
cameras/PoleCameraGrid.tsx ─ real feed beside a twin render, per pole camera
pole-cameras.ts ─ resolves rigs + map signal features
```

`useEditorRuntime` opens a genuine blank `EditorDocument` in memory and binds an
`EditorController` to the viewer, lane index, and indexed ground sampler. The
local `AuthoredWorldSource` compiles that document through the normal playback
compiler and starts its `WorldSession` input in the live-world worker. Truth
frames drive the viewer imperatively; React does not re-render per simulation
tick.
## Running it

A live world needs a browser manifest and a lane topology. Both can be supplied
directly, so an un-ingested bundle is drivable without the authoring
publication pipeline:

```
/dashboard/drive
  ?manifest=/map-bundles/<name>/3d/manifest.json
  &lanes=/map-bundles/<name>/topology-index.json.gz
  &rigs=/drive-rigs/<name>.json     # optional pole cameras
  &twin=1                           # optional: attach to a twin on this host
```

With no `manifest`, Drive uses the first published map (preferring Richmond).
Env equivalents: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DRIVE_MAP_MANIFEST_URL`,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_DRIVE_MAP_LANES_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_DRIVE_CAMERA_RIGS_URL`,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_DRIVE_TWIN_URL`. Camera feeds are proxied same-origin through
`SIMFORGE_TWIN_HTTP_ORIGIN`.

When exposing `next dev` through another hostname, include that hostname in the
comma-separated `SIMFORGE_ALLOWED_DEV_ORIGINS` server environment variable.

Direct bundles must have the same complete sidecar closure as published maps.
The `manifest` must end in `/3d/manifest.json`; `lanes` overrides the topology
used by the live world. Missing compiler sidecars or invalid digests are surfaced
as world-start errors rather than silently falling back to an ad-hoc simulation.

## Attaching to a live twin

With `?twin=`, two further surfaces are driven by the twin rather than invented
locally:

- **Site lighting** (`environment/`) — solar elevation and azimuth computed from
  the map's own geography (`CoordinateFrame` → WGS84, no configured coordinates)
  and the authoritative clock, applied through the shipped
  `applyEditorSceneEnvironment`.
- **Camera feeds** (`@/app/lib/live-world/camera-feeds`) — one WebSocket carries
  every channel, tagged per channel with its honest feed state. Construct it in
  an effect with cleanup because the class connects in its constructor.

### Historical replay

History is capability-driven; Studio does not contain a deployment-specific
archive URL. The `/twin` WebSocket advertises it in `twin_hello.replay`:

```json
{
  "retention_hours": 72,
  "archive_offset_seconds": 0,
  "archive_url_template": "https://twin.example/archive/get?path={channel}&start={start}&duration={duration}&format=mp4",
  "coverage_url": "https://twin.example/detections/coverage",
  "history_url": "https://twin.example/detections/history"
}
```

All three URLs may be `null`. The history dock is shown only when
`coverage_url` is non-null. Its UTC epoch clock comes exclusively from
`twin_mode` and `twin_clock`; both include `replay_speed` (`0` means paused)
and `tracks`. Studio sends `twin_replay { start, speed }` to seek, pause, or
resume, and `twin_live {}` to return to the live world.

When replay mode and `archive_url_template` are available, each camera replaces
the live mux canvas with a muted inline video. A clip is anchored where playback
starts: `{start}` is the detection clock at the seek, rounded down to a whole
second, plus `archive_offset_seconds` (default `0` for older servers), and
`{duration}` is `300`. Playback continues through the clip; a new clip is
requested when the clock leaves it, jumps (a seek), or the served clip ends
early because of a recording gap. Anchoring at the seek keeps a progressive
(non-seekable) MP4 aligned with the clock from its first frame; when the
browser can seek, drift beyond 0.5 seconds is corrected. A non-seekable clip
that starts more than 1.5 seconds behind the clock is re-requested once or
twice with its start led by the measured start-up latency (at most 15 seconds),
so the first frame of the new clip lands on the clock. The camera mux
remains connected in the background so returning to Live restores the canvases
immediately.

## Aiming a pole camera

A rig's numbers rarely match a real installation on the first try, so the
Cameras view can aim each channel by hand: compass heading, mount pitch, mount
height and the four extrinsic corrections, each editable as an exact number
because the target is a physical camera. The resolved scene yaw, vertical FOV
and final position are shown alongside, since the point is to debug an aim
rather than nudge a slider. A REAL-over-TWIN opacity overlay is the sharpest
tool here — coincident road edges and poles expose angular error that two
separate panes hide.

Adjustments live in `localStorage` per (pole, camera) and never mutate the
loaded rig. **Copy rig JSON** emits the complete payload to paste into product
configuration, which is the only durable home for calibration.

## Drive is camera and input ownership

Selecting **Enter drive** designates the selected authored vehicle (or the first
authored vehicle) as ego, starts the document's compiled transport, attaches the
camera through `followCameraPose`, and routes keys to `control` at 20 Hz. Exiting
releases the camera, clears ego ownership, and stops transmitting controls while
the authored scenario keeps playing. Authoring chrome is hidden and the timeline
is read-only only while that ownership is active.

The keyboard effect depends only on stable identities (`source`, `actorId`).
Depending on an object rebuilt per frame can tear down the listener between
keydown and keyup and leave the zero-order-held throttle active.

## Cameras on poles

A rig binds camera channels to a `SignalFeature` id — a traffic-light pole in
the map — and each channel carries its own compass bearing, pitch, mount height
and intrinsics. Pose comes from surveyed map geometry via `resolveCameraPose`
(`@simforge/maps/camera-rig`), not per-site constants. Vertical FOV is derived
from `fy` and image height.

`headingDeg` is a **compass** bearing; `resolveCameraPose` applies the −90 that
converts it to scene yaw, which is why it uses `(cos yaw, sin yaw)` and does not
repeat the local→scene `-sin` from `renderer-contract.ts`.

A pole's `zOffset` is its signal head, **not** the camera height: at Richmond the
head sits at 4.48 m while the rig is at 7 m on the same mast.

Rigs are supplied at runtime and carry the stream URLs. Map bundles are
content-addressed and must never contain endpoints or credentials.

Only the focused channel streams. Long-lived `multipart/x-mixed-replace`
responses each consume one of the browser's six connections per host, and four
of them starve map-tile streaming. Non-focused channels show an explicit paused
state — never a stale frame presented as current.
