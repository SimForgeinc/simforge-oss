/**
 * OpenSCENARIO 1.0 XML → `ScenarioEditorDraft`: the inverse of our own writer.
 *
 * ## Scope, stated plainly
 *
 * This imports **the emission vocabulary of
 * `apps/web/app/lib/scenario-editor/xosc-writer/`** — the eight action kinds,
 * nine condition kinds and two signal emission paths that writer produces, with
 * absolute `WorldPosition`s throughout. It is NOT third-party OpenSCENARIO
 * ingest and must never be cited as such: a file from esmini's own examples, or
 * from a vendor toolchain, will parse (the allowlist parser accepts far more
 * than we emit) and then import as a mostly-empty draft with a pile of
 * `unknown_action` diagnostics. Supporting `LanePosition`, catalogs, controllers
 * or route assignment is a different project with a different scope.
 *
 * What it IS for: closing the export → run → import loop, so a scenario written
 * in the editor, exported to .xosc and run through esmini can come back as a
 * draft the editor, the browser preview engine and the CARLA job pipeline all
 * drive. `importXoscToDraft(writer.xml)` re-exports byte-identically for every
 * writer golden, and that round trip is the spec — see
 * `apps/web/test/unit/scenario-editor/xosc-import/round-trip.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## Fail open, always
 *
 * Nothing here throws, including on a file the security parser rejects. An
 * unreadable document returns an empty draft carrying an `error` diagnostic;
 * an element with no inverse is dropped with an `unknown_action` /
 * `unknown_condition`; a lossy fold is reported as `imported_approximation`.
 * Nothing is ever invented to fill a gap.
 *
 * ## The loss list — what the writer drops, and what comes back instead
 *
 * These are the places the round trip is byte-exact but the DRAFT is not the
 * one that was exported. Each one emits an `imported_approximation`.
 *
 * 1. **`follow_route` and `turn_at_next_intersection` → `follow_path`.** Both
 *    compile to an untimed `FollowTrajectoryAction` over resolved world points;
 *    the road anchors and the junction instruction are gone from the file.
 * 2. **`intercept` → `go_to`.** The writer already flattens the chase to an
 *    acquire-position at the target's start; the import reads exactly that.
 * 3. **`cut_in` with no `gap_m` → `lane_change`.** With a gap the cut-in is
 *    recoverable, because the gap rides on the start trigger as a named
 *    condition. Without one the emission is a bare lane change.
 * 4. **`cruise {speed_kph: 0}` → `stop`.** Identical emission; `stop` is the
 *    reading that survives.
 * 5. **`lane_offset.transition_m`** is never emitted and cannot come back.
 *    **`lane_change.transition_m`** always comes back explicit (the writer
 *    substitutes its 25 m default for an absent one).
 * 6. **`reverse.distance_m`**, **`yield_to`**, **`follow_actor`**, **`avoid`**,
 *    **`autopilot`** and every **disabled clip** are absent from the file
 *    entirely. So is any actor with no resolvable world position, and any clip
 *    whose trigger failed to compile.
 * 7. **A clip `end` of `{kind: "duration"}`** comes back from three places: a
 *    simulation-time stop condition on a time-started clip; a self-referencing
 *    `startTransition` condition on a condition-started LATERAL clip — the one
 *    family that genuinely releases on end; and, for every other family, the
 *    DELAY on a downstream `after_clip` chain, which the writer sets to the
 *    upstream clip's duration. A duration therefore survives whenever something
 *    was chained after the clip. What still does not survive is a duration on a
 *    condition-started clip that nothing chains off: its command stands after
 *    the clip ends, so the writer cannot stop its event without cancelling the
 *    action mid-flight, and nothing else records the number. That imports as
 *    `completion`, which for a `cruise` is the OSC reading —
 *    `{on: "target_speed"}`, the clip ends when the vehicle reaches the
 *    commanded speed, which is where esmini ends the event — and NOT the "hold
 *    until superseded" an authored cruise means.
 *
 *    When the author wrote BOTH a duration and a chain `delay_s`, the file
 *    carries only their sum and they cannot be separated; the whole delay is
 *    read back as the duration, which re-exports to identical timing.
 * 8. **`placement_mode` and `autopilot`.** Every imported actor is placed by
 *    world point, because that is all the file records. A road-anchored or
 *    Traffic-Manager actor comes back as a point/path actor at the same world
 *    pose. `is_static` cannot be distinguished from "authored no maneuver"
 *    either, so only props are marked static.
 * 9. **`path_timing`.** A schedule and an ordering path emit the same
 *    trajectory; only the Init speed differs, and that is not enough to tell
 *    them apart. Imported timed paths carry `path_timing: "ordering"` and keep
 *    the schedule on the `follow_path {timed: true}` clip.
 * 10. **Signal junction and movement identity.** See `signals.ts`: a program's
 *    ids come back sanitized and split at the first underscore, and a static or
 *    scripted plan's junction is synthesized outright.
 * 11. **An omitted `weather` / `roadSurface`** comes back as the explicit
 *    `CLEAR_SKY` / `DRY_ROAD` the writer emitted for it. A draft with no
 *    environment preset at all is recognised by the writer's fallback sun
 *    vector and comes back with none.
 * 12. **Clip ids and actor-scoped names** are sanitized to identifier
 *    characters by the writer, so `my.clip:1` returns as `my_clip_1`. Actor ids
 *    themselves are exact (they are the entity names).
 * 13. **`role`.** An .xosc has no role field. The legacy entity name `ego`
 *    is normalized to the subject role; every other vehicle remains traffic.
