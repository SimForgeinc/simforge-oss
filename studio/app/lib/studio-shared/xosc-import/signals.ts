/**
 * Traffic-signal actions → `JunctionSignalPlan[]`.
 *
 * The inverse of `xosc-writer/signals.ts`, and the hardest inversion in this
 * module because the writer UNROLLS a plan: a fixed-time cycle leaves the
 * editor as a program and arrives in the file as a flat list of per-boundary
 * `TrafficSignalStateAction` events. Getting a plan back means re-folding those
 * boundaries into phases.
 *
 * ## What the file does and does not carry
 *
 * A `program` plan's event names encode the junction and movement
 * (`signal_<junction>_<movement>_t<tenths>`), so both come back — but both were
 * SANITIZED to identifier characters on the way out and the writer joined them
 * with `_` after sanitizing, so the boundary between them is not recoverable.
 * The importer splits at the FIRST underscore, which is exact for the derived
 * junction ids we author (they carry no underscore) and otherwise mis-places
 * the boundary while still re-exporting the identical event name — because
 * sanitizing an already-sanitized pair and re-joining it is the same string.
 *
 * A `static` plan's Init actions and a `scripted` plan's clip events carry NO
 * junction id at all: the file names bulbs and nothing else. Those junctions
 * are SYNTHESIZED (`imported_junction_N`) with one movement per bulb, and the
 * synthesis is reported. It re-exports byte-identically because the junction id
 * never appears in a static or scripted emission.
 *
 * ## The hold tail
 *
 * The last observed boundary has no successor inside the scenario, so its phase
 * duration is unknowable: the file cannot say whether the cycle restarted just
 * after the window closed or ran for an hour. The refold gives it
 * {@link SIGNAL_IMPORT_HOLD_TAIL_S}, the same 3600 s "holds from here" the
 * signal timeline uses, rather than inventing a period that would make the
 * junction repeat on a schedule nobody authored.
