/**
 * `<PrivateAction>` → `BehaviorAction`.
 *
 * The inverse of `xosc-writer/actions.ts`. Reading is a two-stage job because
 * one authored action can become two `<PrivateAction>`s: the file is first
 * read into the flat `ReadPrivateAction` union (a faithful description of what
 * the XML says), and `composeAction` then folds an event's list back into the
 * single `BehaviorAction` that produced it.
 *
 * ## Where the fold is many-to-one
 *
 * The writer's vocabulary is smaller than the behavior vocabulary, so several
 * authored actions share an emission and cannot be told apart on the way back.
 * Every one of them is listed in the module doc of `index.ts` and reported as
 * an `imported_approximation`; none of them changes what a re-export produces,
 * which is why the round-trip is still byte-exact:
 *
 * * `follow_route` / `turn_at_next_intersection` → both an untimed
 *   `FollowTrajectoryAction`, both import as `follow_path {timed: false}`.
 * * `intercept` → a `SpeedAction` + `AcquirePositionAction`, exactly what a
 *   `go_to` with a speed emits; imports as `go_to`.
 * * `cruise {speed_kph: 0}` → a linear ramp to zero, exactly what `stop
 *   {deceleration_mps2: 3}` emits; imports as `stop`.
 * * `cut_in` with no `gap_m` → a bare `LaneChangeAction`; imports as
 *   `lane_change`. With a gap it is recoverable, because the gap rides on the
 *   start trigger as a named condition.

 * Sign converting a TRAVEL-relative lateral value to the lane REFERENCE-LINE
 * frame, and back — it is its own inverse.
 *
 * Every lateral value in the behavior schema is relative to the way the actor
 * drives: `offset_m` positive is the driver's left, `lane_change`/`cut_in`
 * `side: "left"` is the driver's left. OpenSCENARIO expresses both against the
 * lane reference line, and OpenDRIVE's left-side convention runs positive-id
 * lanes AGAINST +s. On those lanes the frames are mirror images.
 *
 * Measured (esmini v3.1.0, Munich_Phase_1A, actor on lane +2): an authored
 * +1.2 m emitted unchanged executed 1.2 m to the driver's RIGHT, and a
 * `cut_in` authored to the left moved the actor away from its target and across
 * the road centre line onto lane -1.
 *
 * Lane-id sign is a property of the MAP, not the scenario: Belmont stores
 * 342/342 positive-id driving lanes against travel, Munich 195/195, and 0/194
 * and 0/344 of their negative-id lanes. So this is a convention conversion, not
 * a per-map calibration.
