 * The relative divert tail (`plans/2026-07-29-one-motion-model.md` §2.3).

 * the same thing wherever the car happens to be, because that is the only reason
 * drawn geometry survives cross-map transfer at all. So the tests are mostly about
 * INVARIANCE: the same tail, from different poses, produces the same shape.
