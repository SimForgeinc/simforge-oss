 * `fitRunwayTurns` recovers it at 0.00 m residual, so the only thing that was
 * missing was a way to SAY it: with `direction` limited to left/right/straight the
 * migration had to downgrade a u-turn to a left turn, which put the car 12.8 m off
 * its authored route while every number in the migration read clean.
 *
 * Two names for one branch is the hazard this pins. The authored vocabulary spells
 * it `u_turn` (matching `RunwayTurnIntent`, which is what a direction is handed
 * to); the map's classifier spells it `uturn`. Comparing them raw makes every
 * u-turn look like a corridor that does not carry it.
