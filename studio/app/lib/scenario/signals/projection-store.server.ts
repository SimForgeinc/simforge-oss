/**
 * The authorized, cached read that gives the signal panel real data.
 *
 * ## Why the bytes are fetched server-side rather than presigned to the client
 *
 * The panel needs {@link EditorSignalControlProjection}, which is tens of
 * kilobytes. Its inputs are a whole XODR and a whole topology index — tens of
 * megabytes. Handing the client presigned URLs for those and building the
 * projection in the browser would ship three orders of magnitude more bytes than
 * the answer, and it would put the native signal catalog (and therefore
 * `contentHash`, and therefore `controlDigest`) on two implementations' worth of
 * environment: a digest that differs between Node and a browser would invalidate
 * every plan authored on the other one.
 *
 * Reading the objects directly by `{bucket, key}` also sidesteps plan §2.5.3
 * structurally rather than by discipline: **no presigned URL exists on this
 * path at all**, so there is nothing to accidentally cache. `control-plan.server.ts`
 * is a pure function of bytes for exactly this reason.
 *
 * ## What is cached, and why that is safe
 *
 * The published artifact set of a map version is immutable: `map_versions` is
 * unique on `(workspace_id, xodr_sha256, coordinate_system_sha256)` and the
 * artifact rows it points at are content-addressed and `artifact_state =
 * 'available'`. Nothing advances a column here while a user watches, so this is
 * the `cacheLife('days')` class under the rule at the head of plan §2.5, keyed on
 * `mapVersionId` (§2.5.2). Published map versions are platform-global; the authenticated wrapper
 * remains outside the cache so session material never reaches cache storage.
 *
 * Authorization stays outside the cache (§2.5.1). The exported wrapper takes an
 * `AppContext` that `requireScenarioContext` already produced and passes only
 * primitives inward, so no verdict and no session material reaches cache storage.

 * absence is a missing map version rather than a degraded one. The derived
 * topology carries only gate conflicts, which
 * {@link EditorSignalControlProjection.conflictPairsByJunction} documents as
 * advisory — an unreachable one costs the pre-flight warning and nothing else,
 * and `conflictSource: "none"` says so rather than guessing.
