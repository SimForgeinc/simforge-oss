/**
 * Artifact reads for the artifacts tab (#146) and the render details tab (#136).
 *
 * THE SPLIT IN THIS FILE IS THE POINT. Plan §2.5.3 requires that a presigned URL is never cached, and
 * the arithmetic leaves no room to negotiate: `MEDIA_URL_TTL_SECONDS` is 3600s pinned at the IAM role
 * session ceiling, `cacheLife('minutes')` expires at exactly 3600s, and every longer profile serves
 * links that are already dead. There is no built-in profile under which caching one is correct, and a
 * cache would also sit beneath the `private, no-store` header the routes set for this exact reason.
 *
 * So the row read and the signing are separate functions: `listRenderJobArtifacts` returns metadata
 * only, and `presignRenderArtifacts` mints URLs per request. Anyone who later decides a metadata read
 * is worth caching can do it without dragging a signature into the cache with it.
 *
 * AS SHIPPED, NOTHING HERE IS CACHED EITHER, and the writer is the reason. `artifacts.artifact_state`
 * moves pending -> available -> quarantined and `verified_at` is stamped by the artifact verification
 * outbox (`bindArtifactUpload`, `completeRenderJob`, `drainArtifactCleanupOutbox` in
 * `control-plane-store.ts`) — worker paths, asynchronous, running while a user watches the tab. Under
 * §2.5 that makes these reads dynamic even though the immutable half of each row (`sha256`,
 * `byte_length`, `storage_key`) never changes. Splitting a row mid-way to cache only its immutable
 * columns would need a second query keyed per artifact id to fetch the mutable half, which costs more
 * round-trips than it saves on tables this size. Refused deliberately, not overlooked.
