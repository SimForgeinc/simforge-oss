/**
 * Conflict-pedestrian stature profiles.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Euro NCAP's CPNCO cell — Car-to-Pedestrian Nearside CHILD
 * Obstructed — is specifically a child emerging from behind an obstruction. Our
 * `pedestrian_crossing_medium_occluder` families have claimed that cell while
 * staging adult walkers, which made the mapping approximate. A live probe of the
 * 0.10 image (2026-07-28) found exactly two child models, and until the walker
 * catalogue fix the generator could not address them at all.
 *
 * WHAT ACTUALLY CHANGES, and what does not. Our occlusion model is a PLAN-VIEW
 * sightline test: the occluder body must straddle the subject-eye-to-reveal-point
 * chord. It has no height term, so a shorter walker does NOT change the computed
 * reveal geometry — it changes what the 3D camera sees, which is the point of
 * the cell but not something the 2D solve can measure.
 *
 * The change the solve DOES see is GAIT. A child crosses at 1.1 m/s against the
 * planner's 1.3 m/s default, so the same crossing takes ~18% longer. Every
 * downstream quantity is derived from that speed — the pre-conflict approach
 * time, the crossing duration, and the curb hold solved against the subject's ETA —
 * so the conflict is re-solved, never inherited. Reusing adult timing with a
 * child walker would place the walker at the conflict point late and quietly
 * turn a staged collision into a miss.
 *
 * Speeds are the repo catalogue's own `walkSpeedMps`, which the probe
 * cross-checked against the spawned actors.

/**
 * GAIT (dib 2026-07-29, BACKLOG #37). Euro NCAP CPNCO-50 reads "a child
 * pedestrian crossing its path RUNNING from behind an obstruction from the
 * nearside" (AEB/LSS VRU Test Protocol v4.5.1). We ship the cell with a WALKING
 * child, so the running variant is the correct reading of a cell we already
 * claim — not a new category.
 *
 * Gait is a SECOND axis on the same re-solve path as stature, and for the same
 * reason: it is a speed, and every downstream quantity in
 * `planPedestrianCrossingForSite` is derived from that speed. It is the LARGER
 * of the two effects. A child at the catalogue run speed covers the curb→lane-
 * centre leg in 1.1/2.0 = 55% of the walking time, so:
 *   - `tToConflictS` falls ~45%;
 *   - the curb hold GROWS by exactly that much, because the subject ETA is fixed by
 *     the back-walk and `hold = subjectEta − tToConflict`;
 *   - the REVEAL WINDOW — step-off to conflict, which is the subject's whole time to
 *     react once the child clears the occluder — falls ~45% with it.
 * Inheriting the walking solve would leave the child holding too short and
 * arriving early, i.e. crossing in front of a subject that is still far away: the
 * staged conflict quietly becomes a non-event, the mirror of the stature bug.

 * emit ZERO scenes: 31 of 39 rejections were the kinematic integrity lint,
 * "child pedestrian has an unexplained speed_discontinuity violation (peak

 * 2.0 m/s is 20, over it. So the discontinuity was always there; the run gait

 *

 * teleport to speed either: the worker clamps its acceleration to
 * WALKER_ACCELERATION_MPS2 (actor_physics.py). Expressing that ramp in the
 * waypoints makes the authored crossing something the runtime can actually
 * track, rather than a schedule it silently falls behind.

 * seconds. Every distance further along the crossing is therefore reached
