/**
 * Snap auto-generated draft actors onto CARLA's *runtime* road network.
 *
 * Background: the AI-Search collision builder anchors actors using two
 * geometry sources that are NOT guaranteed to agree with the map CARLA
 * actually loads at simulation time:
 *
 *   - The Tier-0 gated planner sources gate polylines + the conflict point
 *     from the XODR `MapTopologyIndex` (uploaded OpenDRIVE).
 *   - Heuristic / pedestrian placements project points geometrically.
 *
 * CARLA prunes roads when it loads a map (lanes the OpenDRIVE importer
 * drops, disconnected segments, etc.), so a point that is valid in the
 * uploaded XODR can land off every drivable lane CARLA exposes. Such a
 * draft previews fine in the editor but misbehaves in the sim: the actor
 * fails to spawn, gets teleported by `get_waypoint(project_to_road=True)`,
 * or refuses to follow its path.
 *
 * The CARLA-truth road network already lives in the central map bundle:
 * `bundle.runtime.road_segments` is built from the worker's
 * `world.get_map().generate_waypoints()` crawl (see
 * `services/carla-worker/carla_worker/metadata.py::_runtime_map`), i.e. the
 * pruned drivable network. This module snaps explicit SPAWN points onto the
 * nearest runtime lane of the appropriate type, derives anchors from that
 * runtime lane, and rejects the draft when the nearest valid road is
 * implausibly far (the location is genuinely absent from CARLA's runtime map).
 * Road-mode anchors are not repaired: they must already match an exact runtime
 * `road_id`, `section_id`, and `lane_id`. Path geometry is trusted, not
 * re-snapped (see the vehicle PATH note below).
 *
 * Type-aware: vehicles snap to driving/bidirectional lanes; walkers snap to
 * sidewalk (falling back to other walkable lanes). For a pedestrian crossing
 * only the start is snapped onto a walkable surface — the remaining
 * waypoints ARE the road crossing and are left as planned, so snapping
 * doesn't collapse the crossing onto the curb.
 *
 * Vehicle PATH mode: we snap ONLY the spawn onto a drivable runtime lane and
 * then RIGID-TRANSLATE the planner's `path_placement` (+ destination) by the
 * spawn delta. The planner's pre-snap topology path is already smooth and
 * straight on CARLA-runtime-constrained lanes; reshaping it per-point (the old
 * lane-coherent / nearest-vertex snaps) only introduced junction zig-zag and a
 * tail U-turn. Trusting the straight path and translating it rigidly keeps
 * `path_placement[0] == snapped spawn` while preserving the planner geometry
 * exactly.
