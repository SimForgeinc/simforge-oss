/**
 * Physical traffic-signal heads for the map's 3D mode: where a head is, which
 * way it looks, and which lamp is lit at the playhead.
 *
 * Three things this module settles that the docked viewport got approximately
 * right and the 2D map did not have at all:
 *
 * 1. **Pose comes from the map's traffic-light index, not from
 *    `street_furniture`.** `GET /api/map-assets/[id]/traffic-lights` serves the
 *    runtime bundle's heads already projected into the runtime frame (see
 *    `signals/editor-traffic-lights.ts`); street furniture is lazily fetched and
 *    null unless street-camera mode asked for it, and carries no stop lines or
 *    lamp boxes at all.
 * 2. **A head faces where it was AUTHORED to face.** `<signal hOffset>` plus the
 *    road heading, flipped by `orientation`, is the exact answer, and the index
 *    ships it as `yaw` on an `authored` head. The stop-line bearing survives only
 *    for a head with no `<signal>`: it is a decent guess but only a guess, and it
 *    sits a median ~98 deg off the actor yaw, so the two are plainly different
 *    things rather than a rounding matter.
 * 3. **Lamp geometry follows the cook that produced the bundle.** New-cook
 *    bundles carry `housing.lamps`, the real lens positions, and those win
 *    outright. Old-cook bundles carry no housing and report one `light_box` for
 *    the whole uniform housing, so both 0 and 1 mean "no per-lamp data" and
 *    resolve to the old standard three-lamp fallback.
 *
 * ## Height is RELATIVE, and the bundle's `z` is not
 *
 * A bundle row's `z` is ABSOLUTE elevation (133–144 m on San Ramon P1). This
 * module used to clamp it into `[1.8, 8]` as if it were a height above the road,
 * which pinned every head on five of six lit maps to the 8 m ceiling. The only
 * height in the data that means anything is `light_boxes[0].location.z` minus
 * the actor's own `z` — both absolute, so the difference is the lamp's height
 * above the head's base, and the base sits within centimetres of the road under
 * it. New-cook housings make the same rule explicit as
 * `height_above_ground_m`. That value is the authored `<signal zOffset>`:
 * the mounting point at the housing's base, not its centre. The centre is one
 * half housing-height above it. Lamps remain absolute measurements only long
 * enough to subtract the housing's absolute centre `z`, then move with that
 * corrected centre. Absolute elevation never becomes scene height.
 *
 * ## Unauthored junctions read GREEN, not grey
 *
 * A head whose OpenDRIVE id matches no authored movement resolves to `authored:
 * false` with state `green`. That is not a guess — a junction with no plan is
 * forced green for the whole scenario (`SIGNAL_PLAN_MODE_LABELS.map_default` is
 * literally "Forced green", and the browser engine drives through a null signal
 * as green). Grey lamps on every junction of a fresh map would misrepresent what
 * the simulation actually does. The renderer dims the emissive on unauthored
 * heads so "forced green by default" still looks different from "green because
 * you painted it green".
 *
 * ## Each quantity comes from whichever source is exact for it
 *
 * The two sources disagree, and neither wins outright — which is the mistake
 * two earlier revisions of this module each made in opposite directions:
 *
 * - **Position** comes from the actor/XODR pose for old-cook fallback geometry,
 *   but from `housing.x/y` when the new cook exposes the surviving RoadRunner
 *   mesh. On the old cook the actor is the upright exactly (0.00 m to
 *   `Poles_1`); on the new cook the housing is only 0.25 m from its actor.
 * - **Facing** comes from the `<signal>` on the old-cook fallback. The actor's
 *   yaw is ~95-100 deg off the direction the head looks; `road heading +
 *   hOffset + 180` lands within 8-15 deg of the stop-line bearing on every map.
 *   A new-cook housing instead carries the rendered mesh's own measured yaw.
 *
 * The position-from-actor and facing-from-signal distinction therefore remains
 * essential to the old-cook path, while the new-cook path needs neither
 * inference because the rendered housing supplies both quantities directly.
 *
 * ## Hardware follows the cook
 *
 * The old cook replaced every signal with one `BP_TLOpenDrive`, broken into
 * `Poles_1` (upright), `Poles_2` (arm), `Poles_3` (foot) and `TrafficLight_0`
 * (housing). Its measured geometry remains the nullable fallback:
 *
 *     actor pose            -> Poles_1        0.00 m    (103/103 and 46/46)
 *     actor pose            -> TrafficLight_0 6.01 m
 *     authored (s,t)        -> Poles_1        0.25 m
 *     authored (s,t)        -> TrafficLight_0 6.00 m
 *
 * For that old cook, **the actor/authored point is the pole base** and the
 * housing hangs {@link SIGNAL_MAST_ARM_LENGTH_M} out over the roadway.
 *
 * That old cook also gives **every head an upright**, including every `Bare`,
 * `Bracket` and `Side` one: 103/103 on Di Rosa, 46/46 on Yale. It does not
 * honour the RoadRunner asset, so a `Post`-only rule would disagree with the
 * simulator.
 *
 * The new cook has no `BP_TLOpenDrive` instances. RoadRunner's housing variation
 * survives: four real heights (1.08/1.16/1.26/1.46 m), 74 distinct elevations
 * among Di Rosa's 82 housings, and exactly three measured lenses per housing.
 * Its tall, thin mast meshes are geometrically identifiable even though their
 * semantic type is usually only `Other`: every housing on every lit map has one
 * within 12 m (median 0.5 m). The assignment collapses Di Rosa's 82 heads onto
 * 46 masts, including 19 heads on 9 masts at junction 710.
 *
 * Heads therefore SHARE masts. New-cook geometry draws one pole per distinct
 * `mast.id` and one measured arm from that pole to each sufficiently distant
 * housing. Emitting the pole per head would recreate the old over-poling bug in
 * a form that looks almost right, so mast identity — not proximity — is the
 * deduplication contract.
 *
 * ## Arrow lenses come from the PLAN, never from the signal type
 *
 * `<signal type="1000011" subtype="10">` claims to be an arrow variant and is
 * not one in these files — see the measurement in `editor-traffic-lights.ts`.
 * `signalLensKindIndex` derives protected turns from the authored plan instead:
 * a head bound only to the left movements of its approach, on an approach whose
 * other turns are driven by other heads, IS a protected left, and that is the
 * `refineMovementSignalIds` per-connecting-road refinement showing through. It
 * needs no map data the plan does not already carry, and it degrades to a plain
 * ball head whenever the approach has no per-turn split.

 *
 * Getting this backwards puts a right arrow on every protected left, which is
