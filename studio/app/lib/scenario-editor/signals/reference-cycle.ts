/**
 * One light's timing, and the junction follows: green, yellow, red.
 *
 * Three numbers, and they mean exactly what they say — how long the light you
 * clicked is green, how long it is yellow, how long it is red. The cycle is
 * their sum. Nothing else is asked of the author, and nothing else needs to be:
 * while your light is red, every approach that crosses it takes a turn inside
 * that red window, in the order the junction's geometry allows.
 *
 * ## Why this shape and not the previous one
 *
 * The first version asked for green, yellow, ALL-RED and OFFSET, and derived the
 * red window from however many conflict groups the junction happened to have.
 * That is how a traffic engineer parameterises a controller, and it was the
 * wrong surface for an author: "all-red" is jargon, "offset" only means anything
 * across a coordinated corridor, and the one quantity a person actually pictures
 * — how long am I stopped at this light — was the one number they could not
 * type. Now red is an input and the cycle is G + Y + R, full stop.
 *
 * ## The conflict guarantee
 *
 * Only ONE group is ever green in any interval, and the groups come from the
 * shared `deriveConflictFreeGroups` — the same partition
 * `detectSignalPlanWarnings` checks against. So a compiled cycle cannot raise
 * `conflicting_green`, by construction rather than by testing.
 *
 * ## No schema change
 *
 * The output is a plain `SignalPhaseProgram`. The worker executor, the xosc
 * writer and the browser preview engine consume it unchanged, and the timeline
 * lane decompiles it into bands like any other program.

 * green, five yellow, five red is one complete cycle inside the default
