/**
 * The runtime's own account of how the schedule went, read back for the editor.
 *
 * The sim emits one `timed_point_arrival` per runtime polyline vertex carrying
 * the lateness it actually accrued, and at most one
 * `timed_points_schedule_shifted` for the moment it stopped trying to catch up.
 * Both land in `simulationStore.behaviorEvents` alongside the behavior program's
 * own events. This module is the only place that knows their shape.
 *
 * Why the reads are defensive: `BehaviorEvent` is typed (and, on the CARLA path,
 * PARSED) as the four common fields, so the diagnostic payload rides along as
 * untyped extras. The browser engine writes the store directly and keeps them;
 * `readBehaviorEvents` strips them from a worker artifact, which means a CARLA
 * run degrades to "no lateness reported" rather than to wrong numbers. Every
 * field here is therefore optional at the type level and absent-tolerant at
 * runtime.
