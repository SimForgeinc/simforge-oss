/**
 * Every user-facing word for how an actor moves.
 *
 * ## Why one module
 *
 * These strings were spread across `BEHAVIOR_ACTION_LABELS`,
 * `clipActionSummary`, `behavior-lane-bands`'s own second copy of "Autopilot"
 * and "Cruise", the placement panel and the picker's blockers. A rename was a
 * grep-and-pray, and the two copies had already drifted in casing. Now the
 * dock, the strip, the panels and the tests read the same function, so a word
 * can only be changed in one place.
 *
 * ## The three layers
 *
 * An actor's motion is authored in three layers, and every word here belongs to
 * exactly one of them:
 *
 *   - **Route** — where it goes. Exactly one, always first on the timeline.
 *     `behavior-base-clip.ts` calls this the base clip.
 *   - **Interactions** — what happens to it along the way. Zero or more,
 *     scheduled, layered on top of the route.
 *   - **Reactions** — what it does about things it did not plan for. A standing
 *     `reaction_profile`, not a clip, so it can interrupt either of the above.
 *
 * A word that does not tell you which layer it belongs to is a bad word. That
 * is the whole test.
 *
 * ## Labels are not identifiers
 *
 * Nothing here changes a `BehaviorActionKind`. Those values are serialized into
 * `actor_behavior`, hashed as `actor_behavior_hash`, attested on the way back,
 * persisted in every saved draft, and read by a worker in another repository —
 * and several of them are deliberately OpenSCENARIO-aligned (`lane_offset` ↔
 * `LaneOffsetAction`), which `.xosc` import and export depend on. So the
 * identifier is the wire format and this module is the language.
