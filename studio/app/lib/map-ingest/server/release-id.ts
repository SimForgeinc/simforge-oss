/**
 * Derivative release ids for published map versions.
 *
 * A map version's id is `usmap_` + sha256(workspaceId, sourceMapId, releaseId),
 * and `simforge.map_versions` is unique on
 * `(workspace_id, source_map_asset_id, derivative_release_id)`. Binding the
 * release to nothing but the workspace's active editor asset release therefore
 * makes a map's *content* unable to change: republishing the same map with a
 * different closure resolves to the same version id, the insert is skipped by
 * `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, and the identity re-select fails with
 * `map_version_identity_conflict` because the stored `browserClosureSha256` is
 * the old one. The only escape was deleting rows by hand.
 *
 * Folding a content discriminator into the release id makes both outcomes
 * correct without touching immutability:
 *
 *  - identical content resolves to the same release, so the same version id, so
 *    the publish is idempotent and returns the version that already exists;
 *  - changed content resolves to a different release, so a new version is
 *    published alongside the old one, and the editor's
 *    `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY source_map_asset_id ORDER BY created_at DESC)`
 *    offers the newest. Scenarios follow that source's newest compatible
 *    publication; frozen revisions retain their exact immutable version.
 *
 * The discriminator is computed from the member digests rather than from the
 * closure digest because the closure planner needs the release id as an input,
 * so the closure digest does not exist yet.
