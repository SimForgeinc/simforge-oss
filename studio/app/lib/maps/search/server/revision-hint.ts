/**
 * Turn a failing kinematic-validation report into ONE concrete
 * instruction the LLM can act on in the revise pass (step f2 of the
 * map-search playbook).
 *
 * By the time this runs, deterministic Tier-1 (speed grid) and Tier-2
 * (pedestrian timing solve) auto-repair have already had their shot — a
 * fail here means the miss is something only a *different LLM choice*
 * can fix. So we name the specific lever to pull (location vs. approach
 * vs. conflict-shape), prioritised most-fundamental-first, rather than
 * handing the model raw failure prose and hoping it infers the fix.
 *
 * Returns null when the verdict is a pass (nothing to revise).
