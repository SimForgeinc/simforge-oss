/**
 * Contracts for generating a gallery asset from reference photographs.
 *
 * The provider (Meshy) is asked for a model that is already inside the editor's
 * budgets rather than one we shrink afterwards. That is a deliberate split of
 * labour: the browser import path in `model-import.ts` exists because an
 * arbitrary author file can be a 200 MB non-indexed FBX, whereas a generated
 * model is produced to order. Measured on a four-photo Kia Carnival request with
 * the parameters below: 4.39 MB GLB, 29,706 triangles, one mesh, one material,
 * 5.11 x 1.80 x 2.21 m, no `emissiveFactor` — inside every limit in
 * `contracts.ts` without a single decimation pass on our side.
