/**
 * The route a placed car will actually drive, derived from the lane graph.
 *
 * The editor has to be able to DRAW this. "Place it and it drives" is only
 * honest if the author can see where — an invisible derivation is a promise, and
 * the anchors it replaces were at least visible. So the runway is a server
 * derivation the map renders as the faint continuation of the lane, never
 * something clicked (`plans/2026-07-29-one-motion-model.md` §2.6).
 *
 * Server-side because the derivation needs the whole semantic graph: 4 MB for San
 * Ramon, already compiled and cached per bundle revision here, and shipping it to
 * the browser to walk it there would be the same walk over a much slower wire.
 *
 * Takes the ACTOR rather than a placement so the answer accounts for the
 * timeline: `resolveTurnIntents` reads the `turn` clips that override the
 * straightest-successor pick, and `resolveActorMotion` decides whether this actor
 * has a derived runway at all (a walker or a parked prop does not).
