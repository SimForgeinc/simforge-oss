/**
 * Hide or unhide a render job in the gallery.
 *
 * PATCH rather than DELETE, because this is not a deletion and must not be mistaken for one.
 * `[jobId]/route.ts` already owns `DELETE`, and that cancels the job. This is a soft, reversible
 * visibility flag: the row, its attempts, its events and every artifact stay exactly where they are,
 * `[jobId]/detail` still resolves, and `[jobId]/artifacts` still serves downloads. Only the gallery
 * lists filter it out.
 *
 * `hidden` is required and must be an explicit boolean — there is no toggle. A toggle would make the
 * result depend on state the client last saw, so two clicks racing each other could leave the job in
 * either state with no way to tell which. Sending the desired end state makes the request idempotent.
 *
 * A repeated hide preserves the original `hidden_at` and `hidden_by_user_id` (the store COALESCEs
 * them), so "who hid this, and when" survives a double-click rather than being overwritten by whoever
 * clicked last.
 *
 * Authorized as a CONTENT MUTATION, not a read. Hiding changes what every member of the workspace
 * sees in the gallery, so a caller with read-only access to a shared dataset must not be able to do
 * it.
